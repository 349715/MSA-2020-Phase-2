The Huawei ID login was actually super slick... Like when you want to access your Google password and it asks you to verify your identity on you phone by fingerprint...or WhatsApp Web. - yep I'm a geek 😭 but the easiest way to do it is :
Swipe down on your homepage
Click on the button next to search just on the right of search bar and it auto opens up the QR scanner 💪

I'm also going to be including banking apps currently working along with the other apps in the OP. So stay tuned for that.

Besides the camera, I think the software is still in need of some refinement.

The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).

The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this. 

The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).

US is forcing TikTok US to sell to Oracle then turning around and kicking Tiktok international off the app stores, clearing the room for US TikTok to dominate worldwide, China goes to build its own app store, US sanctions all entities that associates or works with China app store after kicking out Chinese apps from Apple and Google app store.

On top of it, US says any nation that blocks US companies or US apps will be sanctioned and justification for invasion.... like Iraq, Afghan, Libya, Syria, Bolivia, Lebanon, etc etc

Trump is also banning WeChat and Alipay worldwide by removing them from Apple and Google App stores internationally, not just from US. US also sanctions any firm that publishes a version of their app to any Chinese app store.

They also want to force Huawei HiSilicon to sell to Qualcomm and to install a US companyman to board of all Chinese tech companies, and all Chinese telecom companies must submit to US audit and monitoring even within mainland China itself, and China must permanently remove its Great Firewall in addition must give all US companies complete and unfettered access to Chinese markets",1.0,2020-09-14 19:59:05,7.0

It is possible to ''sideload'' GMS into the system, therefore you will need some patience and you will not be able to update all of it. It may also occur that you do not receive notifications.

I have tried the Chinese app store method twice on my P40 Lite and could get it to work for like 5 minutes until I started receiving the notification spam.

Then again, most of the apps will be added through the AppGallery/Petal Search, if not you can use Aurora Store for most of your apps, 

Another thing I'll give you as a tip is; go do some research of Youtube Vanced, its basically YouTube Premium, but then its for free. This is the best alternative to using YouTube through the browser.

I did not have to use the sideload method on both my P40 Lite and my P40 Pro, most of the social media applications are working fine, my banking app works fine and I can receive my mails in the stock mail app (I'm using an G mail account)

"Got my Mate 20 Pro in December 2018. Just got the 10.1 update a week ago, which is the last firmware update this phone will get. So now that it's reached maturity, i feel it's time we spoke about huawei. The hardware holds up incredibly well. A buddy of mine recently picked up the Oneplus 8 Pro and this is coming from him, he claimed that my phone took better photos than his did. I get the option of to choose between a Apple's Face ID style infrared face scanning or an optical in screen fingerprint scanner which if I recollect, not many phones boasted having at the end of 2018. The only design flow is that the speakers are behind the Type C port and it's not even good to begin with but it's gets worse if you decide to listen to something as you tried to charge it. Speaking of charging, the 40W wired charging it came with in 2018 is incredible! It took the competition a good year or more to match or get better.
But none of this would matter if it didn't have GMS. Back when I bought it, there was no clue about a ban. So the only downside of this ban for me is that I don't get the android 11 update (emui 11) on here. So it sucks that I got just one major firmware update.

"That is a terrible idea, the phone is going to be 4 years old in a few months as it was released in early 2017, it basically is at the end of its life.

Since you aren't into smarthones i wont go in depth as to why its a bad idea, ill just say that the battery life is going to be terrible and you wont find a good replacement battery because they just arent produced anymore. Performance and camera will also be quite bad compared to what we have today.

Also no more android or security updates are coming for it.

I don't know what price you can find the pone at to give you alternatives but i recommend you buy a phone launched this year or last year at worst with that money.

"Quite honestly, no.  It will likely take hold in China if huawei hardware can keep pace with its Chinese competitors and Apple. I suppose the govt there could perhaps pressure all the other Chinese makers like xiaomi, one plus etc to use harmony OS instead of Android on all models sold into the Chinese market. That would make a difference to total phones with an Android base software, but phones in China already don't rely on Google apps and services the way they do elsewhere. And then there's still the Apple alternative there. 

As long as the current uncertainty persists that has caught huawei in its web, it is unlikely any big app players or specific bank and company apps would consider modifying for harmony OS.  They just don't want to have to hire and maintain skills for another OS, it doesn't matter if it's windows phone, harmony or whatever.  Companies are interested in achieving marketing and financial goals with a minimum of incremental expense, not increasing complexity and costs. Unless someone's app had a very good commercial reason to be in the Chinese market and they couldn't do it via Android or iOS, I can't see it happening. At least not any time soon.",1.0,2020-09-11 05:03:52,132.0

"You'll need a tripod and preferably a remote shutter in order to keep the phone perfectly still (headphones with button controls will work as a remote shutter).

This will work best on a clear night (<10% cloud cover) with little or no light pollution. Start by setting the camera to Pro Mode, set the focus to manual-infinity, shutter speed to 10 seconds, and ISO to 1600. If the stars turn into streaks or lines, then shorten the shutter time. If the image appears too dark, increase the ISO level. Keep making these adjustments until you get a clear picture of the stars.

For this image, I took 10 photos from the same fixed spot and imported them as a stack in Photoshop CC.

"I had the same problem with notifications and the following fixed the notication issues:


Options for notifications:


1. Naked HMS = poor notifications


2. HMS+GMS = complex hack and have GPS and no notifications or freeze GPS and have notifications


3. HMS+microG = to sync with Google Firebase Cloud Messaging ... basically just install x3 apps from F-Droid after adding the microG repo into F-Droid ..


https://microg.org/


1. Perform a factory reset of the phone.
2. Install Services Core.
3. Install Services Framework Proxy.
4. Install the FakeStore.
5. Open the Microg Settings app. Grant it all permissions and disable battery optimizations.
5.1 Add your Google account.
5.2 Turn on Device Registration, Cloud Messaging and SafetyNet.
5.3 Restart your phone.
6. Open Microg Settings app, check the status under Cloud Messaging. If it says not connected enter the following in the phone app: *#*#2432546#*#* and restart your phone. Check the status again - it should say Connected. (I had to enter the phone string and restart my phone twice until it said connected).

All this will give you is push notifications since we can not enable signature spoofing. If you restore apps from a backup you may have to delete their cache/and or data before they start using Microg for their messaging.

"Is it white or is it just the cover? If it is white, I LOVE the color! Too bad, not many companies offering white color. I passed on to Samsung S20 after my P30 (regular) went to swimming in sea for about an hour (I know..stupid me!) and I LOVED my P30 even tho I hated some little glitches in Emui (nothing serious, for example in my recent apps, it was always displaying wrong apps and when I was clicking let's say whatsapp, it was opening an other app) it was one of the best phones I had ever owned (always owned flagship models).

Passed to Samsung because I always loved the One UI better for the customization possibilities (changing the accent color and icons of quick toggles without installing power share..etc) but still, I still love the Huawei phones and the only reason that I did not consider it was because of the Google ban. Not for the playstore apps, I can side load it..etc, but for me, not being able to use Bank Apps was a deal breaker. I saw that certain bank apps work and certain doesn't, but still, it was a gamble to take. I also don't like the big pill punch hole. I would have preferred a single punch hole.

Having said that, I miss certain camera modes of my Huawei, such as the Silky Water! It is an amazing mode! And I still think that on certain cases (many cases) Huawei takes better photos!! (I buy a phone for camera, screen (i dont like huge ones) and battery life). But on Night mode, which I enjoy taking photos, the RYYB sensor produced most of the times very yellow photos, which was fixable with post processing. Tho on portrait shots, in my opinion, Huawei P30 Pro wins hands down! I can only imagine that P40 pro would be even better! And in Selfie shots I prefer Samsung, even tho I am not a selfie guy, with Samsung, I realized that I started to take more selfies.

And to finish.. that battery life... that is something that I will miss A LOT! Well my regular S20 (Snapdragon - bought an import model) is not bad at all, I am at 57% right now with 21 hours of usage (just around 2 hours of screen on time) , which is not bad, but it is nowhere near my P30 (regular) with less battery capacity (4000 mah vs 3860 mah).

As I mentioned, antivirus on EMUI 10.1 (my phone is a Mate 30 Pro, LIO-AN00 to be exact) is built in. Thus it presumably refers to some malware database maintained by Huawei, whom I trust to be current and not to have to think about. You certainly could try installing some third party package such as Kaspersky, and scanning your phone to put your mind at ease. All that those tools do is to compare the software found on your device to lists of known malware, updated regularly, that's their business. Once satisfied that you're clean you can junk the package, since they're annoying, always pulling at your ear, telling you that you're safe, and to buy premium.

Realistically though, if you had a virus, your phone would be running slowly (if at all), somebody would be demanding a ransom, or whatever horrors await.

"The app you are talking about must be Petal Search. It’s a workaround that Huawei is using to counter the Google ban. I don’t think most people realise that the Google Play store is just another repository for apps - one of many.

What Petal Search does is look for apps in repositories (other than the Google Play Store) like APKMirror, APKPure, etc. To its credit, its remarkably effective, although the repositories it links to are normally powered by Ad revenue so you have to deal with their advertising. Otherwise, the apps it finds are the exact same apps you’ll find on Google Play. 

Another option is to install the [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/downloads.php) - it’s seriously good!

"Well, it's all up to devs whether or not they'll release on app gallery, banking apps heavily rely on security aspect of the device. And, in consequence, are not really keen on releasing the app on the platform owned by a Chinese company once accused of spying for the government. Will they do that? I don't think anybody knows an answer to that question.",1.0,2020-09-03 02:41:39,377.0
"On a technological level, it's a simple thing. Basically, the entire issue of ""doesn't run on Huawei"", simplified, is that the app goes ""Need Google's Map API"" and the phone goes ""Don't have that"" at which point the app goes ""Can't work, will close. Bye.""

So the fix would be that this dialogue would go something like this:

* App: Need Google's Map API
* Phone: Don't have that
* App: Alright, give me Huawei's Map API instead
* Phone: Here you go.

Transitioning an app to exhibit this behaviour is an easy thing. However, why invest the money into it if it doesn't five you any sort of revenue or if you invest 100 dollars and you get 40 dollars back?

That's Huawei's challenge. Because for years, the App Gallery has floundered about because in China, pretty much all of the everything was done using WeChat. And the App Gallery was okay for Chinese needs, as were third party app stores. Meanwhile, internationally, you had the Play Store that did everything anyone could want. 

What Huawei has to do now is convince app developers to make their apps talk to the Huawei Services despite the fact that for the past ten years, entertaining Huawei's needs that are by extension the Chinese market's needs was not something they had to do.

So currently, Huawei is throwing huge amounts of money at this issue. They're lobbying, they're advertising the attractiveness of the Huawei Services, they're doing a lot. And there is progress, but Huawei is facing  market that has had ten years of getting used to a steadily evolving app store. So we expect every little app to work and before most apps work, the App Gallery is just not a viable alternative.

The App Gallery is growing fast, I'll give it that. It's basically unrecognizable from what it was half a year ago. But it's not quite there yet.",1.0,2020-09-03 16:22:28,377.0

"an accusation is just an accusation though. If it was FACTUAL or actually happened then Huawei products would not be sold and the networks would definitely refuse to sell too. My point being, there is nothing that has been proven or factual. In answer to the question itself Huawei posted an article saying they are looking to offer App Developers an incentive for partnering with them. Before Lockdown, snapchat, whatsapp was not available and now in the space of 4 months its available. I believe Huawei will get all the top apps before the end of the year and I believe they will commit to investing within the UK market.

I can only see weaker countries like many African countries due to being pressure by the Chinese financially like they currently are. There really is not going to be any wide spread adoption of the yuan outside of China. I also fail to see how TikTok being banned prevents the yaun being a world wide currency too.
The main issue I believe the US has with the Chines services is their connection with the CCP, which constantly steals from the world and puts its own people down when they do not follow the golden path of the CCP.

"The human body is made of roughly 70% water. If you lose 20% of your water you will start to die, it won't take until you lose every last drop. The way America has structured its civilization is highly leveraged and wholly dependent upon the assumption that the US dollar maintains its global reserve currency status for the indefinite future. This is why when Saddam went of the Petrodollar and started exporting oil in Euros back in 2002 the US invaded and a month after Baghdad was taken the new puppet government reverted back to US dollars....

Likewise, the Yuan doesn't have to completely replace the dollar.... computer chips are the modern oil in this digital age. Right now China is already the world's largest importer of oil, Saudi's largest customer, but it imports more in computer processor chips from the US than it does oil from OPEC based on monetary terms. The US choking China by depriving Huawei of TSMC access to chips and burning Chinese bought ASML EUV machines before they could be delivered and doing everything possible to prevent China from gaining technology independence in the semiconductor industry is akin to what America did to Japan by blocking oil shipments during WWII.

But the fact of the matter is, China is already the world's largest trading partner. If it can persuade or convince even a small portion of that trade to be anything other than the dollar (it can be gold, or any other option that isn't dollar denominated, not necessarily the Yuan etc) then America's days are over....

In fact America was hoping that its NED/CIA would be able to destabilize Hong Kong to the extent that the US could financially ""harvest"" it last year...

When that didn't work, COVID in Wuhan after the October Military games was supposed to finally ""do China in"" and Wilbert Ross was prematurely laughing all the way to the bank thinking for sure this time all of China would be ""harvested"" now... so that America can keep on keeping on with regards to kicking the can down the road...

The US is like vampire, if it doesn't draw blood soon it will collapse... every now and then it needs to sacrifice another nation and harvest another victim in order to stay healthy, its not about the entire world all switching to digital Yuan, as long as China remains independent and no longer relies on America for high tech stuff (MIC2025) then America's house of cards will come crashing down...",2.0,2020-08-30 11:48:03,476.0
"The US dollar demise is mathematical certainty, and math, like physics, is not up to opinion... Learn some history before you say things like ""No Chance""... America is structured so that if it no longer enjoys the global reserve currency status, its Empire will collapse. There is no need for the Yuan to completely replace the dollar, even a multipolar world in which a good portion of the world no longer take orders from US unilateral commands means the US will fall along with the so called Nonnegotiable Way of Life (TM) it has enjoyed for the last couple decades... Every single reserve currency in the history of the world has tanked or been replaced… you shoulder the burden to prove that the dollar is somehow ‘exceptional’ to the rule. It is precisely because the dollar went off the gold standard back in the 70’s that sooner or later the dollar status as reserve currency will tank, either that or US triggers world war III and scorched earth policy means we all burn to extinction… but one way or another its coming to an end, just a matter of timing, but the event itself is a mathematical certainty… Brentwoods had a nice run, Petrodollar hegemony had a nice run… its time… there is not going to be a Libra Dollar this time around. 

I think Russia learned its lesson from WWII, that if it was again able to be convinced to turn against China, and to help US collapse China, that in turn it too would be next to fold… So if anything, in the immediate term its more likely that the US will attempt to strangle both China and Russia at the same time, by cutting them off from SWIFT and also by attempting to enforce some sort of naval blockade.

The acts of cutting China (and possibly Russia as well) out of SWIFT by itself will be meaningless and counterproductive if not enforced by a military naval blockade to stop the physical transportation of goods in addition to the financial movement of money. But this would be the same as declaring war and at that point China has nothing left to lose by not using its carrier killer missiles, after all they are not just for show and were built specifically for contingencies such as these, as well SCS and BRI were also other contingency plans to mitigate the effects of such a predicament imposed upon China by any hostile superpower… and to bring down blockchain (digital Yuan) you would have to take down the Internet or at least cut the sea cables to both the Russia and Chinese landmasses…

America cannot fight both Russia and China at the same time and hope to maintain its hegemony and USD status as global reserve currency… Of course the US has enough nukes to do a scorched earth implementation but that is rather a lose lose situation and hardly considered a net positive win in any perspective. But merely maintaining status quo and a non kinetic solution also seems very likely the US losing its hegemony status over time, just a rather slow and more steady decline compared to a fast and sudden crash if it were to instigate a hot war with a peer power and lose… its much easier for China to defend itself than for the US to attack it on China’s own turf.. at the first island chain the US has no chance, beyond that as time goes on China pushes out further and further, by 2035 US will be pushed back to Guam or beyond at current trends.

(See Century of Humiliation, Chinese Exclusion Act, and Eight Nation Alliance / Opium wars and the forced theft of Hong Kong)

Trump wasn't the first to single out The China Virus ( he means ethnic Chinese people are a virus infecting the world etc) since the Chinese Exclusion Act passed by US gov back in 1880s was the first and only Federal law that forbid a group based on national origin (China) and today we are seeing a repeat of this…

TikTok being forced to sell to US company, Trump taking a cut of transaction, then Chinese parent company Bytedance gets on US entity list anyway, forcing Apple Store and Google Play to delist it internationally is the beginning of the new 21st version of China’s Century of Humiliation….

US targeting China in the South China Sea, getting India, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Japan and Tiawan to gang up on China in the region to cut China off from international trade and access to the open waters is the new Eight Nation Alliance against China….

Huawei, TikTok, DJI, no Chinese firm is safe, whatever the pretext no longer matters, the gloves are off and the US intent is to contain, reverse, erase, collapse China by all means possible… its first time US confronted a great power competition that isnt Caucasian ( Trumps word not mine) and Pompeo believes in the literal “rapture”…. and China being the Central Threat of Our Times…

My impression is the American government will go to any lengths to stop China including if the cost was to include depopulating the vast majority of its own American citizens….

This is the ultimate blackmail... either China kowtows to American terror or the US is crazy enough to make the whole world burn…

Problem is in this game of chicken my fear is CCP will blink first and the 1.5 billion Chinese may once again be forced to slavery and humiliation under a white lead world order and the so called full spectrum dominance etc

Now that China is producing more STEM grads and also more patents than the US, you have folks like Senator Rubio stating that the US should just invalidate or otherwise not recognize Chinese patents, allowing for example Verizon and other US telcos to use Huawei 5G patents for free without payments. Senator Tom Cotton (oh the irony of the surname) who was more than happy to loot Iraqi gold during his Iraq war days, has recently proposed that Chinese students in the US only be allowed to study non-science/ non-math fields such as English lit… and to be barred from any and all STEM fields… The US goes around the world threatening its allies and vassals alike for them to ban Huawei and other Chinese firms and as if that wasn’t enough the US also threatens other nations/firms in the entire semiconductor supply chain from lenses to lasers to EUV machines to assembly and know-how to stop conducting business with Chinese firms or else themselves will face the wrath of the US sanctions machine… So its clear the narrative was never solely about trying to get China to “play fair” or to encourage respect of IP rights…. When China bought a $200 million advanced EUV machine from ASML a while back, there was a mysterious factory fire that destroyed the machine, and by the time ASML could finally send delivery of the unit China already paid for, US had successfully pressured the Dutch government not to allow the export of the EUV machine needed for lithography research…

Bottom line, its clear to me that the real intent is all about great power competition and its about containing China at the highest level and to prevent China from rising above the so-called Middle Income Trap… essentially China was supposed to always be America’s low cost cheap labor factory and the Chinese was to be content with this status quo, never aspiring to anything more… indeed during the “Trade Deal” talks something the US side wanted to get the Chinese side to agree to was to voluntarily stop the MIC2025 and basically stop all high tech research, stop trying to advance in technology and bow out and cease attempting to offer the world any alternatives to the US lead system/platform… Its fine for the Apple iPhone to be made in China, Tesla is okay to make cars in China, but if DJI wants to sell its drones to the world or if Huawei wants to exports if 5G or smartphone then that is the big “no no” and crosses the red line for America…

Every sovereign nation has the right to pursue its own path of ascension but America would have China give up that right and always be content to live under the shadow and umbrella of Uncle Sam… this is nothing but one nation enslaving another…

China said ""NO"", did not kowtow to a Plaza Accord 2.0 etc and the week after the “Phase I Trade Deal” was signed the ""Wuhan virus"" exploded… and the rest is history… I mean it could be a coincidence but come on…. I suppose the Beirut explosion was another unlucky coincidence and had nothing to do with stopping Chinese BRI… I suppose the ASML factory fire that burned up the EUV machine China purchased was just a unlucky timing too…

But the way I see it, there is just too many dots, and its clear what they show when connected… America wants to enslave all 1.5 billion Chinese people, of that I have no doubt.

This is the ultimate blackmail... either China kowtows to American terror or the US is crazy enough to make the whole world burn…

America believes in scorched earth, but I think I do as well… its better that humans all burn and give the rest of the lifeforms on earth a chance rather than China kowtow to Amerikkka and Chinese people willingly becomes slaves of Whitey again…. but that's just my perspective, the CCP is a lot more naive and conservative…",1.0,2020-08-30 11:22:28,476.0

"You should not use r/Sino as a source since they support anything the CCP says, and mostly their lies. The US is pretty bad with its foreign relationships, especially with the current president. But China is also well known for strong arming smaller countries for its resources and money to gain control over them, much like the US has done in the past. With the failed attempt to redo the Silk Road, they force poor countries into loans with insane interests rates to trap them under control of the CCP. In recent events, China has been completely aggressive to all countries. They claim another country, Taiwan, as their own even though it has been autonomous and successful despite the bullying rom China. After being called out for their failure to report the virus properly by Australia, they threatened that there would be ""consequences"". Also the US has not done anything to destabilize anything in Hong Kong, China did that on its own completely destroying the freedom that should be available to any normal person but not given in a China. The US and China are not saints but China is clearly trying to exert its force and control the world to follow the CCP through bullying and playing on countries dependence on them. But most countries can just switch to Vietnam like what's currently happening already, reducing the worlds need for China.",1.0,2020-08-30 13:12:29,476.0

"Wrong, COVID was a covert biowar aka CIA biovirus released by the US to attack China geopolitically, and it was also compounded as a falseflag whereby the suspect blames/frames the victim in order to trick the rest of the world to decouple from China, I talked about this at some length at my blog here:

[https://forum.ascendchina.ch/t/covid-19-uncensored](https://forum.ascendchina.ch/t/covid-19-uncensored)

I'm no fan of r/Sino but the source article is actually an RT article. The Sino subreddit is often than not too conservative and self censors in fear that the West will shut the subreddit down, I've had many moderators tell me that was their fear, that if they truly spoke their minds the Americans will just shut them down with some lame pretext and they would have been silenced...

As for the matter of Taiwan, people are quick to forget that as a condition of the US opening up with China during the Nixon days, the US reversed its policy of recognizing Taiwan as the official China and changed that recognition to the mainland PRC China. Now after 4 decades when China has gotten too strong and its time to ""contain"" China, and when its convenient the US will renege on its One China Policy unilaterally, much like the Iran snapback sanctions even though in both cases the UN has sided with Iran and China on these matters, but US still claims to believe in ""democracy"" yet goes against what the UN says and does whatever it wants cuz hegemony... Most recently, after the US left the WHO via rage-quit, they still wanted to retroactively get Taiwan, (not even recognized by the UN as a country) into WHO membership... I mean the hypocrisy is palpable.

As for the South China Sea, the US itself has never been a signing member and yet wants to stick its nose into China's business, America has 400 military bases encircling mainland China, and has threatened to kick China out of SWIFT and following up with a naval blockage to halt China's ability to access the open seas/oceans and then effectively stop China's physical transport of goods... these are the primarily reasons why China was forced to defend itself, including militarizing some of the islands in the SCS as well as embarking upon the vast BRI project. Freedom of navigation is just a pretext to harass China and encroach on China's turf, much like the ""human rights"" excuse was always a pretext to invade other nations and install puppet governments that would then sell out to the US. The BRI project isn't even slated for completion until 2049, so while US has scored some early wins in terms of the Beirut port explosion incident, the color revolutions of Mali, Bolivia, Belarus, Lebanon etc, its still far too early to say that it has been a failure.

If you don't see how CIA/NED was involved in destabilizing Hong Kong then you have much to discover and learn about how the real world works. But sometimes I agree ignorance can be bliss.",-1.0,2020-08-30 13:30:40,476.0

"About three weeks ago, middle of the night, I was awoken by some genuinely obnoxiously loud music.

I looked out my window to see where the party was, but no sound, I could hear it very loudly and thought it might be next door, but no, the sound diminished as I went towards their wall.

Then I finally realised this terribly, wake you up in the middle of the night, loud music was coming from my own house.

So I ran downstairs to find my Yamaha soundbar was playing kid pop at a very high volume.

Just before the kids went to bed I'd run off the last of their energy with a kids disco. Then during the evening the soundbar had been switched back to ARC, my Bluetooth was turned off, Amazon music had played a couple of other tunes at one point and ultimately been closed.

Yet, here I was, 03.40 in the morning, my phone Bluetooth on, Amazon music playing a tune that had been played several hours before but wasn't saved to my music, through my soundbar which had also switched to Bluetooth.

I still haven't figured out how that happened!",2.0,2020-08-30 21:42:16,481.0

I have a Nova 7i with 8gb or ram and even when I'm playing demanding games, I'm only topping 4gb or RAM usage. And honestly, even if you wanna get that for future proofing, I don't think that there will be an app in the near future that will need you to use 8gb if RAM

I guess it then comes down to memory space. If you're one to keep a lot of videos and pics (which are the main things that will be using up your memory space) then go for the 256g cause  Huawei phones doesn't have normal SD card slots and you have to get the ones that they developed to fit in the slot. But if you know that you'll delete most of them videos and pics then no point overkilling the memory space too

"When it comes to phones, yes. Probably Huawei has beaten the competition into a corner, hands down the best bang for the buck. Even if you don’t go for their flagship, you’re better off than with a similarly priced model from another manufacturer.

The whole rhetoric isn’t about phones though. They make a lot more equipment than that. It’s _that_ part that worries governments. Allegedly.

The basic idea is you don’t want your data ending up somewhere else, or getting a hardware with built in backdoor. One you don’t know about or can’t do anything about.

Not your data as an individual, think military applications, a router in a datacenter housing tens or hundreds of businesses, and so on.

Nobody cares about the simpleton, Google, Facebook, and everyone else sees us as merchandise. The phone segment of Huawei’s business will probably be just a collateral victim.

https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/huawei-chinas-controversial-tech-giant

It also doesn’t help that as a Chinese business you can’t really exist without the Chinese government approval (and if they want you to do something, you probably can’t refuse), that China has been for years copying and stealing IP (people don’t trust them), that they’re accused of a lot of bad things (see Hong Kong, uighur genocide, mass surveillance, crass incompetence when dealing with Covid), that they have an aggressive external policy, that they somehow managed to hijack global internet traffic for a few hours some years ago, and so on.

At the time of writing this (August 2020), PayPal doesn’t currently support NFC payments from directly within the app itself. Instead, PayPal has opted to form a partnership with Google to allow Android phone users to connect PayPal to their Google Pay accounts and even make it the default payment option. That means in order to pay with PayPal in stores, you need an Android phone that supports Google Pay.

"No. It is doing just the opposite, driving app developers to modify their Apps to work without GMS. Think about it, there are over 100 million people (potential customers) using Huawei phones. Android patches and security updates do not come from Google either.

I think we're going to find out soon, that Huawei has started production of their own computer chips too. But America's bullying of Media Tek goes along way further back than this...

After the end of the Japanese and American War (WW2). Instead of returning the Japanese troops to Japan, the US changed the patches on their uniforms, and loaned them to out to Chang Kai Shek, to use them to attack Mao. When they were defeated, they retreated to Taiwan (which was and is, a part of China), and then the US offered them military protection of the whole island, that has lasted to this day. In other words, Taiwan became an illegal Colony of the USA.

So who has the record of being just & fair? 

The only things that are making some Huawei phones become obsolete... Is Apps are becoming larger, and larger with every update, so the first is running out of Ram. The second is Artificial Intelligence, that those Chips need the capacity to run. But the one's that can't, will continue to run, even on earlier versions of apps.

A third thing that might suddenly happen in a year or two too, is Harmony, and that will be a game changer for their new phones.

I think it is an exciting time, and Huawei is going to be around for more decades to come, unless there is War. And that really bothers me right now because you see, it took WW2 for the United States to recover from the Great Depression, and that would be a horrendous psychotic and Evil act, just to resolve all their current problems unfolding at home.

"I’m not so optimistic about the matter to be honest. I think developers have now a reason to not pursue development of their apps on Huawei devices. I mean, why would they if Huawei doesn’t produce anymore ? Samsung and Xiaomi are strong companies and in a market like mobile phones. It’s a matter of time until Huawei becomes the next HTC (or LG and Sony) if nothing is done : a company that is completely inexistent and irrelevant to the market. 

Why would developers take their precious time to bring their apps to AppGallery ? I mean, 100 millions of Huawei devices is great but you have to take all the devices having GMS out of that number to see how many devices with HMS you sold, and I don’t think that number is high enough to convince the big players to come to Huawei and AppGallery. All the devices having GMS will keep on working as expected. 

Now, to the main point, when I was talking about lifespan of the device, I meant : « How many years are you going to keep you Huawei, now that Huawei is such in a precarious situation ? ». Because you have to know a left for dead OS is just going to ruin your user experience, I’ve used W10 Mobile for 3 years, and everything has been falling apart ever since Microsoft dropped support of Windows 10 Mobile. Now I know what you might be saying : « You can’t compare Windows 10 Mobile and AOSP with HMS », but having no unlockable bootloader prevents independent devs to offer custom roms and patches to correct issues that might come up. 

I might be overthinking things, I’m just really disappointed by where this matter is going. I have a P40 Lite and it’s such a superb phone, great photos, amazing camera and gaming performance. But the prospect of no longer being able to use to its full potential and having to retire it early annoys me. 

Now I hope you’re right, I don’t think China will let Huawei down, and this might accelerate R&D in China in chipset departments, who knows, China might be able to produce its own CPUs in 10-20 years.",1.0,2020-08-23 22:50:04,715.0

At first games were unaffected by this scroll lag but I've been playing this game called demon blade and I'm noticing slight lags here and there and I feel like they're getting worse. Chrome froze a couple of times in the past week which is odd cuz the last phone I had, Huawei Y6 2015 despite having terrible hardware and lack of updates, never froze on chrome the 4 years I was using it. Not only that, Y6 only started lagging on Web pages after about 6 months of continuous usage but this 5T had the scroll stutter issue since day one. 


I only had android 10 for about 5mins before I updated it to android 10.1
Maybe that's the issue? I heard that a phone needs a couple days after the update to process all that data and stuff so updating to another version right after could've corrupted some of its data or sth?

maybe go to a huawei store when you have one nearby and explain them what happens ... or ask the dealer where you buy the phone to get it replaced

&#x200B;

The problem with the google chrome... I don't know, every phone I have used had problems with chrome. It feels a bit laggy, stuttery. Maybe chrome needs a NASA phone to work perfectly

&#x200B;

You can try to ""clean install it"" That was the first thing I've done after I had the phone and installed all software updates.

Install every software update until its done, then reset the phone (care, your userdata are destroyed then)

But yeah, my phone runs smoother after a couple of days after everything in the background was done. (Updates, google play updates, app updates, system app updates etc.)

">What do you mean with skipping stuff? skipping frames, text or what?

Like, when you scroll down a web page or any app that's scrollable like Youtube, the scrolling is not smooth. It feels like its skipping frames.. Same thing happens when I drag down the notification bar. The thing is, the amount of lag/skip isn't consistent. Sometimes it's smoother but still lags/skips but sometimes it stutters terribly. What worries me the most is the fact that this issue is getting worse at a terribly fast rate. Like, A couple weeks ago I could use screen recording while playing a demanding game like Black Desert without a drop in the performance but now even scrolling through google play while recording lags horribly. I mentioned Demon Blade before, It's a relatively light game that's easier to run on almost any phone. It didn't have any issue the first couple days but now it's noticeably getting ""slower"" every passing day. I've confirmed from other players that the issues i'm having with the game only happens to me so it's clear that It's due to the phone's skip/lag issue.

&#x200B;

>Did you had the problems just on android 9 (emui 9.1) or on android 10?

I had this scroll issue since the day i bought the phone so since EMUI 9.1

I contacted a customer support agent about the lag/skip issue and another issue where it didn't receive any updates. But the latter wasn't really an issue and happened due to me not putting in a sim so after putting in a sim the phone started getting updates. That customer support agent told me that once I update the phone to the latest software versions the lagging would go away.

After android 10 update everything felt smoother so I thought that the lagging was due to old software but then after a bit I received the android 10.1 update and after Updating to that the lag/skip from 9.1 came back.

I've received a couple more updates after that and the lag/skip issue still persists.

&#x200B;

>maybe go to a huawei store when you have one nearby and explain them what happens ... or ask the dealer where you buy the phone to get it replaced

Unfortunately the ""closest"" Huawei service station is a bit far away from where I live. And the retail shop I bought the phone has the worst customer service in the country. We actually knew this but still went for them cuz they were the only Licenced Huawei agent here. Other retail shops can't give you a Huawei verified Warranty :c

&#x200B;

>The problem with the google chrome... I don't know, every phone I have used had problems with chrome. It feels a bit laggy, stuttery. Maybe chrome needs a NASA phone to work perfectly

Hmm well, It's odd cuz my last phone Huawei Y6 2015; a super low end budget phone that only received 1 update after purchase; didn't lag on chrome like this until after about 6 months. Even after that my Y6 didn't lag on games. It only started lagging on games after like 2-3 years. Nova 5T however despite having a flagship chipset had this skipping issue since day one :/

&#x200B;

>You can try to ""clean install it"" That was the first thing I've done after I had the phone and installed all software updates.

Hmm I did reset the phone about two times but that was before I got the emui 10 update.

I was going to roll back the updates to Android 10 but I'm having some internet issues in my area so had to postpone that.

To tell you the truth, I kinda regret getting this phone now :/   Never expected this phone to be like this. I had 2 phones in mind, 5T and Poco F1; both I picked for having LCD displays cuz I have a personal distaste toward OLED/AMOLED displays due to their numerous issues that affects a phone's longevity. Finally decided to go with the 5T cuz it's purple version looks so pretty.. stupid reason i know :c

oh well, the only option I have rn is to roll back to the android 10 update. That'd reset the phone so i'd be able to do the ""clean install""  you mentioned",1.0,2020-09-06 17:11:08,760.0

"You aren't going to get away with double speak with me pal, I'll call that shit out right away. You implied that without the west China would have nothing. That is not true. 

As well as its own enormous resources (and vast tracts of land and wealth its been buying in Africa and the ME for the last 20 years) China has the rest of the world.

You do realise that there are more potential consumers in that tiny quarter to a third of land mass of Asia that includes India and China than there are in the rest of the world put together right?

You do realise that all of the great ideas the West is built on are themselves built on antecedent ideas from ancient societies that predate and even informed The Enlightenment (including China)? Surely even you have heard of Confucius, Lao Tse and Marco Polo? 

Even some of the great technical marvels of the modern age are not Western. The West has no monopoly of ideas and never had - it just had first world development before the east. 
You only have to look at companies like Sony, Samsung, Toyota, HDFC, Alibaba to see how innovative the Far East is and how unencumbered they are by notions of imperial grandeur and history. 

Asia is the biggest growth region in the world - and that is a fact. It's not 'allowed' to be by anyone and that you think it is says an awful lot about yr mindset. You seem very focused on 'them' vs 'us' and some notion of a 'bogeyman' that we might need to control, a kind of neo-liberal economic imperialism. 

I bet you think BLM is a George Soros front and the Jews control everything don't you? I'd even wager you call it the 'Chinese virus'.

Anyway, in short I kinda like Huawei and their products and I don't see how I'm giving them anymore information that my own govt gets via Google and Facebook and via its own Five Eyes programme (yeah, look up Five Eyes and RIPA in the UK, implications of the Patriot Act in the US, Cambridge Analytica — that's some proper dystopian, V for Vendetta shit right there for you in the West's front yard).

"Your Apps are growing larger with every update, and it is up to the ram, available storage, and the ability of your hardware to handle this too. At some point, after making sure unnessasary apps don't load on startup or run in the background, your going to run out of room. 

From what I am seeing too, the problem is no more access to the Google Store. But if you try a good alternative(like APKPure), it will deliver all the App updates.

The App developer's are very scared of loosing the millions of Huawei & Honor customers too, so they are releasing new versions that don't depend of Google.

As for OS & security updates... I took the risk of buying my 'must have phone' directly from China (I was not going to wait for it to go Global). It has no Google play at all. I set it up very easily, and the first thing I got was the June security update included in the huge upgrade of 10.1/3.1, then another security update a few days later.

"I still receive all notifications for apps on my Mate20 Pro. 

Think about it. 

When you bought the phone the huawei hardware had already been given google certification. You then logged in with YOUR Google account and set up (or transferred) a separate legal relationship between yourself and Google. When you installed apps you added a legal relationship between yourself and the app developer. Those apps send notifications through Google Services and servers. Huawei is NOT part of the relationship between yourself, Google and/or any app developers. Forwarding notifications to any person on any device does not involve the manufacturer of the hardware in that legal relationship. It is device independent. Google is not 'doing business with huawei' if you download apps from the Google Play Store or if they send app notifications to you on your still-certified device. Huawei is not part of that relationship. 

Unless YOU are on the banned entity list then google has no legal reason to cease your individual relationship or to stop forwarding notifications from app developers.

Your OS security updates do not come via Google servers, they come from huawei servers as part of your completely separate individual relationship with your hardware manufacturer and your OS developer - in this case, EMUI which is built on open source Android code and then modified. It does not require Google in that relationship and Google and huawei are not 'doing business with each other' if huawei continues to use and modify open source software and distribute it.

The process involved in the original certification of each mobile phone hardware model to be Google Mobile Services and Play Protect compliant is the only point at which Google and huawei are 'doing business'. As it applies to your pre ban already certified hardware model, the rest is noise.

Ignore the scare mongerers, huawei haters, Trump haters, ignorant bloggers, etc and enjoy your excellent still Google-certified phone for however long you may wish to own it. I am going to do the same.",2.0,2020-08-18 14:17:47,881.0

The most popular apps are releasing versions that don't need Google Play anymore, because the can't ignore the millions of Huawei & Honor user's. I recommend APKPure for accessing those versions, and updating all your apps also, right beside App Gallery. 

Stay away from people who promise apps or fixes to solve the problem, they still don't exist. Security updates will still continue because they are open source. 

However, all your Apps will continue to work, it will effect some of your Notifications (for payments too), Gmail (but you can still access that through your browser), Google maps, and Google pay.

"Thanks for this. Between your reply and others it sounds like there's a lot of uncertainty but google apps could potentially be lost. I've been looking at some of the alternatives but the notifications are important for my work so that's a worry depending on which notifications get affected. I've no issue changing my email app, but use google pay, maps and assistant all the time. I've baked some of those services into other things I've built to make my life easier so losing them would be a real blow for me.

Over the years I've spent a lot of time on the bleeding edge of technology and also with technology I've built myself. Experience has taught me that doing so requires consistent effort, willingness to get one's hands dirty and an acceptance of the fact that from time to time things might not work when you want them to. After spending some time with rooting and CFW, I realised not too long ago that when it comes to phones, I just wanted something easy, reliable, with a bit of customisation possible (android gives me that), that wouldn't let me down when I needed it.

I'm definitely leary now in Huawei's abilities to deliver consistent and timely updates.

"You will receive security updates (Google has little control over those, because those come from the Open Source Android community).  As for OS upgrades, those depend on whether your hardware can handle them, and Huawei invests in the skin.

I'm just saying that the US administration has said some ugly things about Huawei (with no proof), while calling Edward Snowden a 'Traitor' for proving to all of us, American does it all day, every day. We are all caught in the middle. I ordered my phone on Alibaba, directly from China. It was not available in my country, and has no Google Pay. It works just fine, along with Reddit, WhatsApp. I just source the apps (and updates) though APKPure and Gallery, instead of the Google store. 

If you financed your phone, and are worried, you do have some leverage with your provider (especially since you are loosing any confidence in the phone) 

However, I studied finance, and I can tell you your provider is not waiting for your small payments to arrive, they already have the money. When you signed that Contract, they bundled it up with all the other Contracts and  sold that week. They were all sent to a clearing house, and were inserted into consumer (junk, because you did not put up any collateral) Bonds, and were sold to Investors, hoping to make their money on the interest you will pay.

I would have advised against signing anything except a Mortgage, because most of them have become Predators, hoping you will make a small mistake, because they now make the majority of their profits charging Penalties, Late fees, and raising up the interest on that Loan to around 25 to 30%.",1.0,2020-08-18 21:32:06,902.0

"I studied Treaties, contract law, and ran a very large group of people for a company involved rebuilding specifically Manufacturing companies.

On the one hand your absolutely correct, and being objective on this matter, I am correct too. This is not about mudslinging or hurt feelings. 

It is deeply unfair to the consumer, but like Huawei, the both have no control over the US government's idiological drive to treat every country as a future Colony of the USA.

While the US has been caught repeatedly hacking foreign telecoms (in mass data collection) and their important Leaders individual phones for years, they choose to alleged (without any Facts), that Huawei is the security risk.

I blame the US government for fabricating hatred + fear, so that people blame China, as the USA continues to screw them out of the use of the product they enjoy, thereby giving the US permission to do anything it wants to retaliate for them, because someone must be punished. 

Your blame was not directed at Google, who has gone along with all this nonsense too, and has made $Billions in US military contracts for years. Or Taiwan, who cut off sales of chips to Huawei (at the US's behest). A longer look back into Taiwan's history might answer this..

In the closing moments of WW2, Russia having defeated Hitler, finally was able to help China. Two attacks by the Russian army forced the Japanese on mainland China to except defeat, and the Emperor of Japan was reaching out to surrender, when the US dropped those two bombs.

As Russian forces packed up to go home, the US (instead of marching those Japanese troops to the beaches to ship them back home) changed the badges on their uniforms, and gave them to the Chinese distant Chang Kai Shek, to attack Mao. 2 short years of more brutal War, and Shek retreated to the Chinese island of Taiwan, and the US gave that island complete military protection.

So like Britain, who took Hong Kong because China lost a war with them, only to try to stop England from flooding their Nation with highly profitable Opium, China for the most part lost Taiwan too.

The people of the US blame China for stealing their jobs. However it was the US government (well really, the US corporations who run the US government) allowed a trade policy were the US companies gave those jobs to China, to take advantage of the cheap labor.

So now we are all in the middle of this mess, trying not to get hit too, and wanting to throw a punch. The real problem is, the US did not think that Chinese people were smart enough to develop better technology (a purely Racist belief), and is now more than slightly embarrassed to find themselves #2.

"You’re gonna have to sideload a few apps from other sources. I use the Aurora store app to get apps and updates that aren’t available in Huawei’s store. If this will be your only phone it could be a little tricky to get by judging from my own experience. Some apps won’t work without GMS and it’s harder to make in-app purchases. Also, the equivalent of Samsung Pay isn’t available in western countries. 

However, the phone is a beast. The camera is insane and battery life is really impressive. I’m a person that loves phones so I buy new ones every now and then. As a complement the P40 Pro is a great device, but then again my trusty old iPhone XS is the phone that I rely on daily. As a daily driver I’d advise against Huawei phones because of the uncertainty. For example in my city I wouldn’t be able to buy bus tickets if I only had the P40.",1.0,2020-08-17 21:10:27,909.0

"If you don't want to use Hisuite bloatware, you can go to settings / system & updates / developer options / select USB configuration / then select MTP. Then connect your phone and use as a USB storage.

 When you unplug the phone, hisuite invasion will kick in and resets  your developer option, so you need to do it everytime you connect your phone.

Alternatively, before I found the above way, I tried the app ""CX file explorer"" that we can use to ftp. But that doesn't solve my problem of needing to connect the phone to friends PC's to share stuff on the fly.

I am on a Mate 20 pro running EMUI 10.0.0.240. but it did work on the newest EMUI 10, before I rolled back to the previous version. And I wish I can rollback to EMUI 9 because hisuite wasn't forced on us then, but they don't allow it. I rolled back because the previous version, which I am on now doesn't have the HMS Core bloatware services, and the APP Gallery that welcomed me with an accept to give all my data to some European marketing company!

 I think your lucky! I was disappointed that I had to accept the agreement releasing my data for them to sell,  instead of allowing me to use the already built in function to connect the phone to a PC. But they gave me no choice but to give them my data. And that is my good bye to Huawei, I am in progress to finding an alternative.

"Hi,

I didn't even try to install Google apps. For that matter, I didn't even try to install Huawei apps either. What worried me, was using other mainstream apps, that Google had finessed too much control over the user's functions... Notifications, updates, maps, and premium paid for services, just to take the 30% cut they charge on all sales.

But the Android ecoco system was becoming too diverse, and with Huawei becoming large enough to invest the vast amounts of money needed to create a legitimate competitive alternative to their Godly power (While, Google focused on buying up major apps, to solidify there monopoly position) the time for me was ripe. There are plenty of alternative download sites, payment systems, and the app producers are releasing versions of their apps that don't need Google services anymore, because they can't ignore the millions of customers who use Huawei devices.

So I have WhatsApp, Reddit, can order food, make reservations, but tickets, shop at home, watch movies, all without Google at all. 

The fact that Huawei is being so violently attacked, as a security threat... when even the most casual users, now know that Google, major social media companies, and all telecoms have be giving security services a backdoor straight in to our private lives, and have even been tapping the phones of other countries leaders and decision makers... has created a situation where it is to the advantage of Google, to go along with these completely fabricated accusations, if the end result is Huawei is destroyed.

Do it think that is going to happen? No. Nokia, Samsung, Apple, etc, etc... are all manufactured and assembled in China, and shipped overseas. So if the threats became too much, China has the power to shutdown all global cellphone production in a single day, by ordering the halt of all manufacturering + shipping.",2.0,2020-08-20 20:04:04,925.0
"You hit the nail on the head there...they are really basically attacking Huawei...can you imagine I just ordered a Honor X10 5G a few weeks ago and the very next day I read Huawei would not be able to make its Kirin chipsets anymore because of the ban? I was shocked 🤨... now it seems they don't want them to even use US tech in their phones 🧐...idk how China is going to retaliate and if they will but you are right, I think its too extreme...

To go to such lengths to kill competition...? Its really starting to look like that is the ultimate goal. Just a few weeks ago Huawei overtook Samsung as the biggest smartphone company and then just a week after that all these restrictions just come crashing down on Huawei....this comes months after Huawei introduced the Kirin 820 chipset which even rivals the best mid range Snapdragon 768G chipset... coincidence or just very convenient...?

Its all really fishy tbh... people aren't even really reviewing Huawei phones as before, I struggled to find in 
-depth reviews for the Honor X10 5G on YouTube, only one YouTuber really reviewed the phone...the ban and fear of China using personal really affects alot... imagine if the privacy invasion accusations they pinned on China wasn't even as major as they play it out to be...",1.0,2020-08-20 22:05:23,925.0

They then use this information correlated with other searches to build a profile to sell u shit. Google has then given the intelligence services backdoors into being able to access this information, due to terrorist laws...only,they don't even need a warrant lol.

Huawei just produces really cheap good quality hardware that uses western software. Its that software that spies on us, not huawei as a company.

Changing how they work and delivering all the power possible to certain parts of the phone is supposed to be bad for ur phone and can make it heat up to the point of catching fire. That's what they say anyway but if China unlocked theirs then all of China can get on google services and give the US more info and relatable marketing info that they can use to look more deeply on China operates, that's what google does with the info it passes back to US intelligence services... And likewise with Cambridge Analytica and the scandels the UK gets involved in that nobody knows or cares about.

Huawei as a company though do not spy on its users. They sell phones for cheap because they can make a profit on them because Chinese working class in their factories are on like £2/hr.

And the phones are SICK mate my Honor View20 is amazing for example.

... And the new Mi 10 Ultra lol is only £600...but might not even come out in the UK.

But when u say u don't trust any company that collects data about u, reddit does that everytime u use it. Websites now can track how long you stay on a page, how long u type on it, how complex the language is ur using on it, how quickly u flick between pages, do u read the articles or just the comments? Do u vote with the hivemind or comment on controversial comments? How well is reddit altering how you think? How agitated do u become when politics gets involved? All this shit reddit already knows about you mate. And they use this data to see how effective and how much more effective they can be in what they want to achieve.

The spying goes on with whatever free software/services you use... Thats why they're free. But Huawei as a phone manufacturer uses Android which has already been studied by GCHQ and the actual head of MI5 said that theres NO evidence Huawei spies. Huawei is the biggest mobile phone producer now and that's all its about, dominating the market. The 'phones spy on u', is American BS.

Can imagine the same happening with Xiaomi as well in the future because check the Mi 10 Ultra for £600...like wtf LOL go on utube and watch a review.

Then the new Pixel will come out with a quarter the charging speed and a 8th the camera zoom and MP and on maybe a 855+ chip with 6GB ram... Then charge twice the amount and you'll see on reddit BUT THE SOFTWARES GOOD COZ U GET UPDATES FIRST! LOL. Seriously mate just look at the specs and costs. China is just producing better products than America now and for cheaper and that's why there's so much fake news surrounding Huawei.

They are deffo a part of the CCP btw. But I don't see a difference buying clothes or bedsheets or curtains or carpet or PC parts or TV parts or whatever made in China as stuff made in China is everywhere.
