Google Apps - Alternatives?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/gs4rxt/google_apps_alternatives/,"*UPDATE1*  I'll be updating this list to have a comprehensive list of app alternatives that work on HMS devices. Please feel free to make suggestions. Thanks! 

*Update2* Banking apps added

*Update3* Alternative App Stores added

Hey Guys, So I'll be getting a P40 Pro soon in the post, and I thought I'd collate some alternatives to Google and fully embrace the change rather than install GMS on it as it has some issues at the moment with notifications, doesnt fully fix the Google Pay issue and the method could get stamped out at any time by Google/Huawei:


----------------------------- **Banking Apps** -----------------------------

Tested and working:

1. Tesco Bank (phone clone)

2. 1st Direct (phone clone)

3. Halifax (phone clone)

4. Lloyds TSB (phone clone)

5. Santander (phone clone)

6. HSBC (phone clone)

7. Monzo (phone clone)

8. Nationwide

9. Royal Bank for Canada (phone clone) thanks u/crackmacs

13. Discover (US) (phone clone) - thanks u/chessieblack


----------------------------- **App Stores** -----------------------------

**1. Aurora Store** - Most closely mimics the Play Store and even tells you which apps are GSF dependant or not, so you get an indication of which apps will work - this is only an indication as some apps will safe GSF dependant and still function 95% correctly - (download FDroid https://f-droid.org/ and then search for Aurora Store)

**2. Petal Search** - Specifically designed by Huawei to act as a search engine for apps using all of the third party app stores as sources (APKPure/Aptoide etc) - (download from Huawei AppGallery)

----------------------------- **Google APPS** -----------------------------

**1. Google App** (Search app when you swipe right on homescreen) - Best Alternative 

*Huawei Assistant (pre loaded) - gives you a search option and news feed basically the same

**2. Google Photos** - This serves two functions one is to view pictures and two is to back them up. Best Alternative - 

*Huawei app gallery (pre installed, to view pictures -may seem obvious, *what new phone doesnt come with a gallery, email, phone, sms app*.... but just for completeness) 

*Huawei Cloud - new P40 series devices seem to be offering between 5-50GB free for the first 12 months and only £9.48 annually for 50GB after that  

*Deego a new app I've noticed in AppGallery that offers up 100GB of free storage but has ads in the home page..meh?)

**3. Google Duo** - Best Alternative - 

*Zoom (Huawei AppGallery)

*Skype for business (APKPure)

**4. Gmail** - Best alternative - 

*Huawei's email app accomodates exchange, gmail, hotmail, yahoo and others

*Protonmail (thanks /u/paganini_33)

*Tutonata (thanks /u/paganini_33)

*Here Wego Maps (available from Huawei AppGallery)

*Waze (download from petal search)

*Magic Earth Navigation (download from Huawei ApppGallery)

*Maverick - not a navigation system but an impressive collection of detailed road, public transport, cycling and hiking maps (download from Petal Search) (thanks /u/creeper828) 

**6. YouTube** - Best Alternative - 

*use mobile browser to access mobile YouTube website and create shortcut on homepage for convenience (thanks /u/tonymohd)

*NewPipe (download and listen to youtube with screen off) (download through FDroid)

*YouTube Vanced (best alternative with ability to sign into google too)

**7. Google Drive** - Best Alternative - 

*Huawei Cloud - 5GB (50GB for £7.88 a year)

*Yandex.disk - unlimited photo storage - use as backup, you get a few russian ads but nothing intrusive. works on HMS download through APKPure (thanks /u/UnclePadda) 

*Deego - 100GB free (ads)

*OneDrive (for any 365 users) - 10GB free otherwise - (download through Petal Search) thanks (/u/Claidheamhmor)

*andOTP (download via Fdroid) - (thanks /u/kylezz)

2. ADT Control (US) (phone clone) - thanks u/chessieblack

1. Periscope zoom rocks and will become more and more common on smartphones.

2. It performs amazing in low-light condition.

* I took some near pitch black photo where iPhone pretty much gave me close to nothing while P40 Pro saw something. Neither photos are usable but it shows the impact of  RYYB sensor.

These pics were taken before Samsung 20 Ultra was released and I have lately been testing how P40 Pro compares with 20 Ultra and to noon's surprise P40 Pro still wins in pitch black situation and extreme low-light situation.",4,2020-09-14 15:11:57,4
Photos disappeared off my P30 Pro.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ish67o/photos_disappeared_off_my_p30_pro/,"Going through my photos today I noticed that a large chunk of my photos taken Saturday have disappeared. They are not in my deleted photos and I've tried some suggestions online like clearing my cache but nothing. The only proof I have that they existed is that I sent some of them to a friend over Facebook Messenger. The photos that disappeared are quite important so I'm panicking a bit. I know my phone was acting up a bit, having a hard time loading moving pictures, but these were just normal pictures that just suddenly disappeared.

I've read that Quik app converts the 3-second motion pictures you take on Huawei to mp4 so you can share them with friends who don't use Huawei phone.  But I'd like an easier solution (I take a lot of motion photos)

US is forcing TikTok US to sell to Oracle then turning around and kicking Tiktok international off the app stores, clearing the room for US TikTok to dominate worldwide, China goes to build its own app store, US sanctions all entities that associates or works with China app store after kicking out Chinese apps from Apple and Google app store.

On top of it, US says any nation that blocks US companies or US apps will be sanctioned and justification for invasion.... like Iraq, Afghan, Libya, Syria, Bolivia, Lebanon, etc etc

Trump is also banning WeChat and Alipay worldwide by removing them from Apple and Google App stores internationally, not just from US. US also sanctions any firm that publishes a version of their app to any Chinese app store.

They also want to force Huawei HiSilicon to sell to Qualcomm and to install a US companyman to board of all Chinese tech companies, and all Chinese telecom companies must submit to US audit and monitoring even within mainland China itself, and China must permanently remove its Great Firewall in addition must give all US companies complete and unfettered access to Chinese markets",1,2020-09-14 19:58:33,7

2. Is there a way to use it as an interval timer, for tabata-like training? I have seen from some video reviews that it has an HIIT mode, but I'm not sure if it is just for tracking or if it offers an interval timer.

[Need advice] P40Lite - android`s separate accounts work/private - both full user rights?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/irc6of/need_advice_p40lite_androids_separate_accounts/,"Can i grant owner rights for newly created android user?
Even now I discovered I cant make a hotspot under the second user..


Below is what I wrote few days ago when all of this really annoyed me:

idk if I'm misunderstanding something about how it should work, or its damn useless.
Decided a while ago to stop carrying with me two phones (business one and my private one), and make use of my work dual sim huawei and androids system accounts. Main user - work profile, created user - private profile. Id prefer it this way in any case some administrator of this device would like to get it to their hand and configure something for me.

The two problems I have for now:
- being on my private profile I dont recive SMS. I can send them, they appear in the QKSMS but when I recive a message it pops out in the system Messages app on my work profile - I can't see it in QKSMS on private profile.
- all the contacts appear on the work profile. There I can go to contacts->display preferences and pick if I'd like to see the ones stored on SIM1 or SIM2. There is no such option on private profile, I cant see any of my contacts.
- with problem 2 comes third. I have a WhatsApp installed on my work profile and ffs I dont want it to access my private contacts, upload it any-damn-where and mix private/work contacts when I choose a new message.

It came up like a little whining, but let me know if theres a way to manage it like this.
I want to have separate profiles for work and private.
Best would be if work profile accesses contacts only on SIM1, and private profile on SIM2.
Separate SMS for both SIMs or at least just let me manage all of the messages from my private account.

I thought also - switch the profiles is the only option? But as I said, I'd prefer to have my work prifile with the ""Owner"" rights and even switching them would result in messages adressed to my work number not arriving when I'm on work profile.",1,2020-09-13 01:01:01,73

My experience trying to get my Huawei phone fixed in the UK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iqq0bi/my_experience_trying_to_get_my_huawei_phone_fixed/,"I thought I'd write out my recent experience of trying to get my Huawei P30 Lite repaired in the UK, as it was helpful for me to be able to read other peoples experiences on this subreddit.

First, I think the P30 Lite is an amazing device. It's stunning how much you get for your money. Sadly mine developed a battery fault where the battery started expanding, and eventually popped the back off the phone.

Sending the device off for repair was easy with the support app on my phone. That gave me a prepaid postage label I could use to send it off to the manufacturer. I think the support app is a really nice feature, I liked the tracking of your repair as it goes through.

This is where it starts to go wrong. So it got sent to a 3rd party repairer called SBE. After a couple of weeks my phone was returned. No work had been done, no explanation or contact. Just a piece of paper in the box that said ""Not repaired by SBE"". The faults obvious, you can see the battery expanding out of the back.

I contacted Huawei support to find out what had gone wrong. They said they'd need 3 days to investigate. Huawei never contacted me back.

I got in touch with Amazon as I bought the phone through Prime. They said I could return it as it was defective, and generated me a post label back to the original seller. I sent it back to the seller. I had to pay my own post. I didn't hear anything for over a week even though I paid for guaranteed next day delivery. I did some googling of the sellers address and in the past couple of months there's hundreds of people posting reviews that the seller wasn't sending them goods. And some people who were local saying the premises are abandoned. I'm trying to get through to Royal Mail now, see if there's a way for me to get my parcel back (forgot to add a return address to the package).

The Amazon problems are nothing to do with Huawei, they're just an unfortunate extra problem I've had. Thought I should write it out my experience see if anyone else has had similar issues.",2,2020-09-12 01:01:46,97

[Troubleshooting] Phone does not make calls to other customers from the same carrier,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iqksq6/troubleshooting_phone_does_not_make_calls_to/,"Hi all!

I'm having an issue with my Huawei P30 phone and on the AT&T network. I have 3-5 bars of network to be able to make calls but I am unable to make a phone calls another AT&T customer. I am able to make calls to T-mobile, AT&T prepaid but does not work to other AT&T customers who are on a monthly plan.

I have removed the sim card and placed it back in. I have restarted the phone. I called tech support as well as go into the store to get the sim card replaced but to no avail. I am able to search and used the data provided by AT&T on my plan but the only thing I can't do is to make calls to other AT&T customers. I have also resetted my network settings and tried multiple APNs and they all did not work.

Does anyone on r/huawei have a clue on what this issue is or have experienced an issue like this?

Help with multi screen collaboration,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iq9844/help_with_multi_screen_collaboration/,"Hey everyone, a few days ago i got a Huawei D14 laptop and a P smart 2019 phone. Both work great on their own but I have had some issue syncing them together in various ways. I try to connect my phone to the laptop through the PC Manager app that comes preinstalled on the laptop but it does not work. There are three ways it says it can connect, the first being an automatic scan that did nothing (and yes, bluetooth, wifi and NFC are enabled on both devices and Huawei share on my phone), the second, a qr code that bought me to a website with a broken download link and the third being USB connection which it didnt seem to recognise. When I press the NFC area on my phone on the Huawei Share NFC area on my laptop it brings my phone to the Huawei share website. Another strange note is that when trying to fix this I downloaded the HiSuite app to test that instead but it did not work on my laptop but did work on my desktop despite the USB ports on the laptop working and it even recognising through file manager that the phone has connected, so i suspect its a problem with the Huawei software rather than the hardware. 

Anyone had a similar experience or knows how to fix this? Its been really annoying trying to fix it and I dont really want to send them back so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Other notes that might be important is that the pc and phone do connect via bluetooth through the windows settings and that I tried downloading and installing the APK from the QR code on PC Manager but it simply would not install on my phone even after giving the needed permissions, and seeing that I have more than enough storage space.",1,2020-09-11 06:32:20,137

#### Smarter and Smaller than Huawei 5G CPE Pro

Comparing with the Huawei 5G CPE Pro, the 5G CPE Pro 2 has smaller dimensions but better specifications. They are both based on Balong 5000 chipset, but Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports WiFi 6 and provides double of peak download speeds than that of Huawei 5G CPE PRO. In addition, Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports more 5G & 4G network frequency bands:

Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports:

\* 5G Band: n1/n3/n5/n/7/n28/n38/n40/n41/n77/n78/n79/n80/n84

\* 4G Band: B1/3/5/7/8/20/28/32/34/38/39/40/41/42/43

Huawei 5G CPE Pro supports:

\* 5G Band: n41/n77/n78/n79

\* 4G Band: B1/3/5/7/8/18/19/20/28/32/34/38/39/40/41/42/43

📷

#### Latest WiFi 6 standard

Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports latest WiFi 6 standard. The device thus transmits with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax, supports the two common frequencies 2.4 and 5 GHz and 2 × 2 MIMO. According to Huawei, the WiFi peak download speed can reach 2976 Mbps. The theoretical download peak speed can reach 2402Mbps on 5GHz and 574Mbps on 2.4GHz.

Like the predecessor Huawei 5G CPE Pro, two LAN ports (RJ45) with gigabit speed are available for wired connections. One of them is also a WAN port. There is also an RJ11 telephone connection on the back. And there is a USB port. However, the connectors for external antennas are missing in the Huawei 5G CPE router.

As a stationary router to use at home or in a office, there is no integrated battery in the [5G WiFi router](https://www.4gltemall.com/5g/5g-cpe.html). The Huawei 5G CPE PRO 2 is therefore dependent on a nearby socket to get continuous power supply. The dimensions of 94 x 94 x 178 mm cannot be distinguished optically from its predecessor. If you need a router with antenna connector, the Huawei 5G CPE Pro now is in good price. If you need better performance in a good signal area, Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 is good to consider.",4,2020-09-08 15:05:11,202

"Storage numbers seem off, and storage not freeing up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ioox3j/storage_numbers_seem_off_and_storage_not_freeing/,"Howdy!

Over the months (had this since around November) 8ve downloaded a bunch of files using a video downloader app.  Yesterday the storage became full so I deleted a bunch of big files but the storage capacity didn't move.

When using the optimiser mode to delete stuff, the used storage went down, but going into gallery > videos it only ever moved a fraction, even when deleting several gb at a time.

So now I'm stuck with apparently only 10gb storage left but I deleted a tonne more than that 😣

I've explored optimiser and can't see anything like a recycle bin or anything obvious to make the phone see it should have more space.

So now I don't know what to do as I should have loads more space than the phone says I actually have. So what are my options here?

Also the amount of space used by apps seems disproportionate. 35gb but I've been through settings and there's 10gb worth, with a few extra for downloaded stuff like Netflix and Spotify. 

How do I make the phone see the proper numbers here?

Apologies for the layout, its fine when I type it in mobile. Then when it posts it's mushed up!",1,2020-09-08 18:54:28,207

Anyway my question is ;is the P30 is still worth it in 2020 or are there better alternatives? Because at the moment on huawei france I can get a new P30 for 380€. I was very happy with the phone obviously but I'd like to know if there are better alternatives out there for around 400€.

I've tried all of the possible solutions to this, like factory resetting it, trying to clear the cache and trying to boot it up on safe mode, but none of these work, the phone still continues in this sort of loop.

Also just before this happened, there was a popup about ""updating the device"" and ""a connection is needed for it to update"" so maybe these factors also affected something.

A Month with the Matebook D15.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/imwfr6/a_month_with_the_matebook_d15/,"I've had the D15 for a month now and it's a really great buy. The laptops here in my country is pretty pricey (for a third-world country) and the laptops in the same price range from the D15 are always Intel i3 or i5 and only gives 4GB of RAM out the box. I've seen a lot of reviews of the D15 and it's what I wanted for some time. So when I finally got it, I was ecstatic.

The previous laptop I owned (for 4 years) was an Acer Aspire E14 that has an Intel Pentium and 2GB of ram (I know, very pitiful) so using the D15 was a whole new experience. I have days when my browser is open to Youtube, Google Meet and random articles, while Word, Xodo PDF reader and Messenger are open all at once and I felt little to no stuttering. 

I've tried photo editing (Inkscape) and while the display isn't the greatest, it's not that bad. The display was a little washed out but a few tweaking from the  AMD Radeon Software was all it took to make the viewing better. I also did a few video editing with Sony Vegas 18 and it felt smooth.

I'm honestly not much of a gamer but I really love pixel art games (and Resident Evil) so Stardew Valley, INMOST, Dead Cells, Party Hard 2, CARRION and NEO Scavenger worked seamlessly. For the RE games, the recent titles needed to be played on medium settings for good frames but RE4 and below wasn't a bother when playing their HD remastered version in their highest settings. 

So far the only downside for me was the battery life. But I opted to leave it plugged in while I use the Battery Protection (I charge my battery up to 60% and use the Family Mode) from the pre-installed PC Manager.

&#x200B;

The only major problem I faced was **when I got my first ever BSOD three days ago.** I was checking a notif from my phone and when I return to my task, the File Explorer wasn't responding so I End Task it from the Task Manager. Suddenly the whole desktop turned black and so I had to force restart it when it was stuck like that for 10 minutes. When I powered it back on, I got the blue screen that said **INACCESSIBLE\_BOOTH\_DEVICE**. I tried recovering from a restore point I created but that didn't work. I tried to troubleshoot the Startup settings but it didn't work either. My last hope was the command prompt but it didn't recognize a command midway through the process so I was forced to reinstall Windows. Good thing I had all my files backed up so please **BACK UP YOUR FILES EVERYONE.**",3,2020-09-05 18:33:15,287

Huawei B535 4G Router 3 Pro Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/imcws5/huawei_b535_4g_router_3_pro_review/," 

Huawei 4G Router 3 Pro with model number B535-232 has also been available in many countries since early 2020. The device is a [4G wireless router](https://www.4gltemall.com/4g-wireless-router.html) of the middle class and available for just under 200USD without a contract. It’s design for indoor use with reliable performance for home networking. Below are the details **specifications of Huawei 4G Router 3 Pro B535**:

##### [Huawei B535 4G Router 3 Pro](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-4g-router-3-pro.html) Specs and Features

##### Information material

User Guide:N/ADatasheetN/A

&#x200B;

#### Up to 300 Mbit/s download rate

The ""Huawei B535 4G Router 3 Pro"" contains the Huawei balong chip, an [LTE CAT 7](https://www.4gltemall.com/ue-category/lte-category-7.html/) modem. It supports downloads with up to 300 Mbit/s and uploads with a maximum of 100 Mbit/s. However, these are of course only theoretical values ​​and in practice are usually significantly lower depending on the network environment. The [Huawei LTE Router](https://www.4gltemall.com/4g-wireless-router/huawei-4g-lte-wifi-router.html) supports almost all LTE frequencies represented in Asia and Europe. Bands B1, B3, B7, B8, B20 and B28 are specified by the manufacturer. Unfortunately there is no information about carrier aggregation combinations.

If no LTE network is available, the Huawei B535 Router alternatively switches to 3G/UMTS network. Here it is on the bands B1 and B8. Older standards such as GSM or 2G are not available as an alternative. Since the LTE network is already very well developed for most network operators worldwide, this should not be necessary either. The prerequisite is an inserted SIM card in micro format in the existing card slot.

&#x200B;

#### No WiFi ax

To improve reception, the Huawei B535 WiFi router can be equipped with an external cellular antenna. Two connections are available for this. There is also a WAN/LAN port on the back as well as three additional Gigabit LAN connections. Various LEDs are lined up on the front to tell various connection status information, such as 4G, WLAN, LAN, signal strength and power.

Up to 64 devices can be connected wirelessly to the Huawei B535 4G Router 3 Pro via the B535's WLAN network. The device transmits on the common frequencies 2.4 and 5 GHz, but does not support the new WLAN ax / Wifi 6. There are 802.11ac/a/n 2 x 2 and 802.11b/g/n 2 x 2 MIMO. The maximum wireless transmission rate via the dual-band WLAN antenna is 1,167 Mbit/s.

#### No integrated battery

In addition to the LTE router itself, the package content also includes the mandatory power supply unit and a stand to place the device. The power supply plug port is also on the back of the LTE router. The device does not offer an integrated battery, so there must always be an electrical outlet nearby.

The 219 x 138 x 25.6 mm large and approximately 325 g heavy LTE router, is primarily intended for home use. Installation is easy and takes place via the compatible Huawei SmartHome app. A multilingual quick start guide is also included for commissioning and clarifying questions. Among other things, support for password-free access to HiLink devices, changing WLAN names and much more is possible via HiLink Smart Home. Other features include SMS service, firewall, PIN protection, MAC address filtering, Wi-Fi encryption, VPN tunnel and VPN penetration, IP penetration, IPv6 and IPv6 / IPv4 dual stack, multi-APN, WeBUI, Administrator maintenance, HOTA and more. However, there is no telephone function.

Actually, similar to B535 4G Router 3 Pro, Huawei had presented many similar 4G LTE WiFi Router to the market, such as [Huawei B612](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-b612-4g-lte-cpe.html), [Huawei B525](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-b525-4g-lte-cat6-wireless-router.html) and [Huawei E5186](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-e5186-4g-cat6-802-11ac-lte-cpe.html) etc… They had different appearance and design, but functions are very similar. They are good for home or office networking. If you are interested in Huawei 4G Router, you may select one from them.",0,2020-09-04 21:31:22,316

So i bought Galaxy Buds+ and I am using them with Honor 10.  
I know, that this phone has only BT 4.2, Buds doesn't have aptX codec (+my phone doesn't have Samsung codec), but ... I am using AAC codec, everythinh is fine, except latency (for example when i press play, there's small delay, same when i press pause) ... Is this usuall with this phone ( BT4. 2), or something is bad on my side?  
I asked in one FB group and one guy told me, that he had H10 with Buds+ and everything was fine (now he has Samsung phone) ... also I read one topic about which budget wireless headphones buy for a Honor 8X, the person bought Lamax Dots1 and also wrote, that there is no delay (visible)...

I can still navigate the phone (albeit very badly), as i found i can turn the torch on, accidently called someone, its just i have no display. Ive tried force restarting with holding down the power button for 10 seconds, but that didnt work.

Cannot disable knuckle gestures,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ije8r3/cannot_disable_knuckle_gestures/,"Hi there. 
I'm on a P30 pro, latest EMUI 10.1.0.140.
My fingers are frequently mistaken for knuckles.

Disabling all knuckle Screenshot gestures did not do it.
As I read elsewhere there was also a split-screen knuckle gesture, which appears to have been replaced by the ""multi-window dock"".
So when I use my knuckles on screen, the left to right gesture is still recognized only to show a hint to use the new dock. I can choose to ""don't show again"" which will disable the hint.
But yet still knuckles and also annoyingly sometimes regular touch input is falsy recognized as knuckle gestures. 

Is there some way to turn it off, that I missed?

Hope everyone is doing well these days!
This is my first Reddit question that I'm ever asking lol.
I have some questions about the Huawei P40 Pro or Pro + which are EXTREMELY important for me to know as soon as possible. I have a Huawei P30 Lite which I love, the only thing that bothers me about it is that I don't have NFC ( because I have a Canadian version 🙄), no wireless charging and not the best camera. I love taking quality pictures so having a crazy good camera is a priority for me. I love the quality pictures of the P40 Pro but that phone might have some issues for me; I want to have Google Play store, receive notifications for all the apps, have all of the latest updates for the apps, be able to use Google maps and be able to use the phone for contactless payments (Google Pay or something). Is it possible to have all of that with Google Mobile Services installed on the P40 Pro? Now, I'm debating on what to get when there will be end of year sales: a P30 Pro or P40 Pro. Is it really worth getting a P40 Pro over the P30 Pro just because of the camera quality ""improvement"" ? If I can't receive notifications of the apps (like from social media) on the P40 Pro, then it's an absolute no buy for me. I don't want to spend more that 900 CAD$ on the phone. Huawei Wallet is not available in Canada.
I hope someone can answer all of these questions for me 🙏🙏🙏.

"What the Huawei, WeChat and TikTok bans all have in common, US desperate to cling to its dollar privilege...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iiy58g/what_the_huawei_wechat_and_tiktok_bans_all_have/,"It  is all about the **petrodollar hegemony**…. Trumps EO to ban  WeChat/TikTok  etc and Pompeo’s Deep State “Clean Network” is in part  designed to  slow the internationalization of the digital Yuan. This is  the biggest  threat to US. If China rolls out DCEP and foreign merchants  can use  Chinese fintech platforms, I.e., alipay and wechat pay, to  conduct  cross-border exchanges then the USD and by extension the US  empire is  doomed. The timing of these announcements are partly due to  trump’s  reelection and partly because the US is starting to feel the  heat,  given the recent announcement regarding ant financial IPO and DCEP   testings… Recently Trump hinted that AliPay could be next on the list.   This has nothing to do with spying/backdoors/IP theft but ironically   everything to do with “National Security”….

The  US actions actually make perfect sense when you look at it  from the  perspective of US attacking China in a full stack manner and  making  sure that America retains dominance in the entire stack… Think of  the  OSI model in networking, in order for applications to communicate   across distances each layer has to be working. The more layers American   can dominate in then the more chokepoints it can use against percieved   enemies such as what its doing with the Google Play ban against Huawei…

At  the network level its all about the raw transport of  communication,  and here its 5G as the future. If American can convinence  its allies  and vassals in the world to use non-Chinese vendors then in  the future  America can leverage Western dominance of the networks to ban  Chinese  apps, commerce, communication directly at the lowest network  layer.  This is what the fight for 5G is mostly about…

Then  there is the end-point layer of the stack… IoT devices,  smartphones,  smartwatches, etc… here the US is using its sanctions power  when it  comes to semiconductor supply chain to deprive Huawei and other  Chinese  telcos and mobile makers the ability to compete  internationally… if  the only phones allowed are iPhones and Samsung  (also US controlled)  then America can cut China off and isolate China at  the endpoint levels  as well…

Then there is the  firmware/software/storefront level… In this context  Google is operating  as an intelligence and sanctions arm of the US  government at both the  firmware (Android OS) and store front (Google  Play) level… Apple the  same. Even if the device is a Chinese one, if US  can sanction at the  store front level then it can still strike at  applications at will by  simply getting them delisted…

And  finally at the application level they can force the likes of  TikTok to  directly sell to American companies… If it cannot buy, it  bans… likely  the fate of WeChat (which China won’t sell) and AliPay…

Bottom  line its all about controlling the coming 4th industrial  revolution,  the IoT smart devices, AI of the future and also about  preserving the  petrodollar hegemony… WeChat is already a payment system  but not yet  widely used by the West. Why was TikTok banned first?  Because it has  been adopted in mass by the West and the US citizens, so  it wou’ldnt be  hard for TikTok to incorporate a payment system and tie  in with the  digital Yuan and that overnight would be a direct challenge  to the US  dollar…. so even if American couldn’t target it at the app  level it  would target it at the firmware/storefront level, the endpoint  level,  and the network level…

American’s  greatest fear is the world using Huawei (Chinese ) 5G for  the network,  Chinese mobile phones (be it Huawei or Oppo or Xiaomi etc)  for the  device endpoints, and Chinese apps like WeChat/TikTok/Alipay for  the  payments, coupled with Chinese BRI and the fact that US is printing   like there is no tomorrow with QE Infinity, the writing is on the wall…   If the likes of Huawei, TikTok, WeChat are allowed to proliferate   worldwide and help the digital blockchain Yuan gain mass adoption, and   if BRI were to succeed and invalidate America’s naval blockade plans   hatched up for China, then China already being the world’s largest   trading partner, it would be able to easily offer the rest of the world a   viable solution to counterbalance the US regime’s increasingly wanton   and reckless abuse of weaponizing the US dollar global reserve status  in  strangling other nations and essentially taxing and enslaving the   world… If the day comes that America can then no longer lie, cheat and  steal, then it collapses upon itself….",22,2020-08-30 07:04:48,476

BPSM - battery power saving mode 
I have a P30 pro (upgraded from a P20 lite) and on both phones I used the BPSM beacause it about doubled the battery percentage at the end of the day.
Even though I love that feature, I can't get over the fact that it will turn my screen off after 30 seconds of being idle. 
On the Huawei support website they explain why you can't change the sleep timer sometimes and how to fix that problem by turning BPSM off first ([site](https://consumer.huawei.com/eg-en/support/content/en-us00787692/)). 
Is there a way to keep BPSM on and extend the sleep timer at the same time? Or is there a third party app which does the same thing as BPSM and doesn't reduce the screen sleep timer?

"Huawei Mate 10 Pro charging super slow, SuperCharging not working",https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iia994/huawei_mate_10_pro_charging_super_slow/,"Hello everyone,

over one night to the other my Huawei Mate 10 Pro charges super slow.

Measured with the App ""Ampere"" I only get 300 mA. I tried several charges, cables and combinations. Even though using the original Huawei Charger with the  4A Cable im not getting more than 300 mA. So also Super Charging stopped working.

Also for me it feels like the battery drains faster...

 So from my understanding it could be either the Charging port or the battery. What do you guys think?

Is it hard to replace both of them?",1,2020-08-29 04:27:33,535

Huawei Mate 20 Pro slow and completely bugging out.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iho3dm/huawei_mate_20_pro_slow_and_completely_bugging_out/,"I've had this phone for a little over a year now. Super fast and reliable... until like two months ago.

First issues started with Chrome freezing up randomly, which forced me to exit to homescreen before eventually reopening Chrome again. This got worse and worse, with me having to close to homescreen/open really frequently, and up to three times before chrome decided to finally settle.

At first I thought this was a chrome related issue, that I wasn't alone on this, and a bug fix was on the way. The second thoughts started to soak in when I deemed myself unsuccessful in finding a reliable answer to my hair-pulling chrome insanity. 

The second thoughts didn't stop right away though, as the phone started slowing down, not registering my taps properly, and started force quitting out of apps randomly. Three weeks ago I tried to factory-reset the phone. This had remarkably little to no impact on all of the mentioned bugs above. Just recently the keyboard stopped working properly at times, and let's say, won't pop up until I tap the adressbar in Chrome 2-3 times. 

Here I am, stuck with a once dearly beloved device (or software for that matter) that decided to backstab me for good, or at least for now, as it seems. Force-quitting apps, freezing, including a choppy and laggy fluidity in the UI in general, thanks to annoying bugs.

To close things off, I'm really suspicious about the official EMUI 10 update, or later updates, as the device worked flawlessly before. But once again, as people seems happy with their Mate 20 Pro after EMUI 10, and I can't find someone complaining about the same thing, I'm kinda targeting this as an issue with the phone's hardware right now.

Would really appreciate different thoughts/inputs on this. In that case, thanks in advance!",0,2020-08-28 04:21:53,566

Google Maps Commute Notifications on Mate 20 Pro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ih28cr/google_maps_commute_notifications_on_mate_20_pro/,"Hi everyone,

ever since I've got my Mate 20 Pro I stopped receiving commute notifications from Google Maps. It worked perfectly on my old phone and I never got into a traffic jam. No matter how I change the settings in the app or the system, it just won't work. As there were some problems with not receiving notifications on that phone from the beginning, I'm starting to think it's the phones' fault.

Are these notifications working for anyone? Does anyone have any hints what I could try?

App mistakes my Huawei tablet for a phone,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ih2czw/app_mistakes_my_huawei_tablet_for_a_phone/,"Hi everyone,

I'm running Autodesk Sketchbook on a Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite 10, which runs android. This is my first Huawei device. I love the tablet and I love the software, but I'm having an issue with the Sketchbook UI.

At first, it ran as intended. I installed the software and had a menu with 3 toolbars: 1 along the top, and 2 on the sides. I think this is called the ""Rapid UI"" and is specifically for tablets. I really liked it.

Then the next morning (08-01-2020) the UI had changed. There was only one toolbar now, and it was along the top. Also, the screen wouldn't rotate anymore despite auto-rotate being enabled on the device. After looking into it, I believe this is the handheld version of the UI, meant for phones.

Apparently the software ""determines the device it's running on"" and displays the corresponding UI, but in this case it's wrong! **Is there any way for me to tell Sketchbook that this is a tablet, not a phone?**

I want the tablet UI back, but nothing I've tried has worked (reinstalling Sketchbook, rebooting tablet).

Thanks in advance!",0,2020-08-27 04:43:28,599

There are also quite a few connectivity issues.

I don't think there's any contact issue with the screen since the taps and strokes are really noticeable and all over the screen. A restart usually fixes it for a while.The 3.5 mm jack only works if you push the connector really hard and rotate it. Still, the phone often says it can't detect any headphones. Yeah, and the screen has yellow-brown spots. Warranty is out so there no point in that.

I have a question about the two USB ports of the Matebook 13 2020.

I am thinking of buying this laptop but I am somewhat unsure about the ports. I understand that the laptop can only be charged through the left USB port. The right-side USB port only does data transfer. However, does this also mean that the right-side USB port does not supply power at all? Whilst at the same time charging the laptop, I would like to use a document scanner ( [https://www.czur.com/product/shineultra](https://www.czur.com/product/shineultra)) that is connected and powered through USB-A (2.0) at 5V-500mA. Would I be able to operate this device like this using the Huawei USB-C - USB-A adapater on the right-side port?

A second question I have is about data transfer speed. Is there any difference in transfer speeds between the left side and right side? Given that the scanner uses USB 2.0, I imagine there should be no problem with transfer speeds, but I'd still like to know.

I cant connect KVM to it as it is not boot up yet, I cant iBMC its old IP but I dont know why, maybe because it still in starting state and iBMC is still not load yet, I cant shut it down or reboot it due to the locked state.

Trick to enable third party launchers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ifvise/trick_to_enable_third_party_launchers/,"As most of you will know Chinese versions of Huawei devices don't allow changing the launcher anymore. The workaround of uninstalling the stock launcher through adb has also stopped working on latest updates.

I was pretty bummed about not being able to use Nova launcher on my newly purchased Mediapad M6 and then it hit me. **You don't have to change what the default launcher is. You just have to change what happens when you press the home button.**

So my plan was to just remap my home button to run Nova launcher instead of the system launcher. That way, the only time you see the Huawei launcher is when you reboot the device? When you tap the home button, it takes you right to your third party launcher of choice. 

Now to remap the home button. Turns out remapping hardware buttons is pretty easy but most navbar customization apps are very limited. It's neither just cosmetic changes or you can only map double tap actions. In the end I settled on an app called [Gesture Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conena.navigation.gesture.control). An option to hide the stock navbar is included, so no messing around with adb necessary. I had to adjust the app's power usage settings and now it's running permanently as a complete replacement for the system navbar. The app allows me to have a pretty much fully functioning third party launcher and some handy additional gestures.

It's a pretty simple thing but I haven't seen this trick mentioned anywhere so I won't to share it with you guys in case anyone else has been struggling with getting third party launchers to work.

A few weeks ago my HMXP started showing the BSOD for some reason and freezing every now and then. I’ve done everything that was suggested on blogs and on Huawei’s website.

I’ve updated drivers and cleaned caches and the BSOD appearances stopped. But now my laptop completely freezes 1 minute after turning it on, I can’t even get to the system update page.

Does anyone have any tips?

How faster is kirin 820 compared to kirin 810?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ig0az6/how_faster_is_kirin_820_compared_to_kirin_810/,"My xiaomi mi 9 just broke 3 months ago after I was on a vacations with my friends and accidentally broke it as I completely forgot to put the cover on it and let it fall from the hotel we were sleeping into.

Unfortunately, I didn't have lots of money to buy a new flagship phone so I went to a local shop and brought a Huawei p40 lite 4G, thinking that it didn't have any difference when compared to the 5G version.

I went looking on the internet and found out the two versions are different matter entirely, which left me completely shocked and angry.

I am someone who games a lot and loves emulation such as Wii and gamecube on android, so I always want to get the best processor when It comes to gaming.

That said, is the difference between these two processors insanely big? Or better yet, how powerful is the kirin 810? Cause I saw benchmarks on the internet saying that the kirin 820 plays is stronger than last year's snapdragon 855, but I didn't find anything interesting regarding the power of kirin 810.

Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 Available to Buy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ifllyd/huawei_5g_cpe_pro_2_available_to_buy/," 

As the upgraded successor to [**Huawei 5G CPE Pro**](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-5g-cpe-pro.html), the new and more powerful 5G Router Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 is available recently in the markets. The Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 comes with the model number H122-373, which was introduced in early 2020 and now is for sale in China and some European countries.

&#x200B;

## Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 Specifications

Like the predecessor, Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 is SIM unlocked for global use. Alternatively, the 5G router can also be purchased together with a contract or with a contract extension. The Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 is a high-quality and very well-equipped 5G router for stationary use. The chipset of the [**Huawei 5G router**](https://www.4gltemall.com/5g/5g-cpe/huawei-5g-router.html) is the Huawei Balong 5000 chipset, combined with the Huawei Gigahome WLAN chipset. A special feature in comparison with other router models is the integrated active fan, and according to Huawei sayings, this should work very quietly.

Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports various 5G NR frequency bands including bands n1/n3/n5/n/7/n28/n38/n40/n41/n77/n78/n79. According to Huawei, the theoretical maximum data rates of up to 3.6 GBit/s in download and 250 MBit/s in upload over 5G. When working on 4G LTE networks, 1.6 GBit/s can still be reached in the downlink and 150 MBit/s in the uplink. In addition, the [5G router](https://www.4gltemall.com/5g/5g-cpe.html) even supports the 5G standalone standard.

&#x200B;

The [WiFi module](https://www.4gltemall.com/m2m-lte-module/quectel.html) in the Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports the latest WiFi 6 standard and can therefore easily forward the high mobile speeds to modern end devices. In theory, up to 2.4 Gbit/s are possible in the 5 GHz band and up to almost 600 Mbit/s in the 2.4 GHz band. The router can connect up to 128 devices at the same time. Since the Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 also supports WiFi mesh with ""HiLink Mesh"", the WiFi network can be expanded accordingly if required.

Like the Huawei 5G CPE Pro, Huawei has also installed two RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet connections, one of which also works as a WAN port if required, i.e. here you can connect the router to a DSL modem, for example. A PDF data sheet with the complete technical data of the Huawei H122-373 5G CPE Pro 2 is available for download from 4gltemall.com .

Here now, the Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 is available to buy but price is a little bit higher than the Huawei 5G CPE PRO. If you can’t wait to enjoy amazing 5G surfing speed, Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 will be a good option for you. Here you can click the link to buy this new 5G router: [https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-5g-cpe-pro-2.html](https://www.4gltemall.com/huawei-5g-cpe-pro-2.html)",1,2020-08-24 21:10:28,686

Huawei Nova 3i not playing full stereo audio?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ifiuut/huawei_nova_3i_not_playing_full_stereo_audio/,"Hello all.

I have a Huawei Nova 3i phone, but when I have been listening to music on it I have found that it is not playing audio in full stereo.

What I mean is that the audio is not completely mono - there is still some panning from left to right within tracks - but it does not pan all the way.

For example, at the start of the song ""How Soon Is Now"" by The Smiths, I do not get the effect of the guitar at the start rapidly changing from left to right. At the start of Money by Pink Floyd, the cash register sounds pan left and right a slight amount, but nowhere near as much as they do when I am listening on a laptop or another device.

I have tried multiple apps (youtube, spotify, opera, chrome), and multiple pairs of headphones, both wired and bluetooth, and this still occurs.

I have made sure mono audio is turned off in settings. 

I've been trying to figure this out for a long time, any help would be massively appreciated.

Discussion regarding Huawei’s ban,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iez7mu/discussion_regarding_huaweis_ban/,"So, as you may know, Huawei cannot use the Google Mobile Services on their latest devices. 

The US government has established restrictions on Huawei’s access to chips on Monday. Basically, they can’t ask TSMC to produce their chips and can’t buy chips from 3rd party-party manufacturers like Mediatek, and the Mate 40 series will likely be the last smartphones Huawei manufactures. 

Seeing the critical situation Huawei is in, Huawei might go down, or worse bankrupt. Though I don’t think the Chinese will allow such a big company like Huawei to go down.

And so my question regarded the Huawei devices with HMS : what will we do if it happens ? 

Let’s see what would happen if Huawei went bankrupt : 

No software support, which means GMS dependent apps might stop working after a while. 

Now it doesn’t look like a lot, but we can’t unlock the bootloader (requires a code nobody has) and I’m not sure alternatives like MicroG will continue working on the long run. 

And so another of question I had was : Do you think the latest US restrictions greatly reduced the lifespan of your device (P40 series, Honor 9X/9X Pro, Honor 30 series, Mate 30 series) ?",2,2020-08-23 19:40:31,715

So lot’s of people recommend to change the DSL from the DSL category from ADSL2+ to ADSL or G.Dmt (because hell, pings in games are so high, and people assume they’re better options for gaming), but I can’t see that category under the Basic section, same goes with the Advanced section, no QoS and many other stuff.

So I thought the firmware had to be updated or something, but turns out in the Device category there were absolutely no update firmware.

&#x200B;

Is this a problem from my ISP or has the HG531s (The s version, not the non-s one..) been updated remotely recently so that it limits its options? (Although I have no idea why you would do such thing so I assume you did not)

Can anybody guide me over here?

Camera and other questions - P30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iedkxd/camera_and_other_questions_p30/,"(This is for the Canadian variant, if it makes a difference)

If any of you who are super familiar with the P30 can help, I'd appreciate it. I have a great opportunity to get this phone with my carrier for a decent price and have been doing what I usually do which is watch and read lots of videos and reviews. But there are things I don't understand. For one, I mostly take manual mode photos. I'm a bit picky, I'm a photographer and videographer so ""auto"" mode is rarely capable of taking good photos (in my opinion). In any event,

My questions:

1. Can you set the camera to take photos in 16X9 aspect ratio? Saw a video that showed the photo settings menu but it was unclear whether that option was there.

2. I understand that the camera takes photos at the 40MP but saves them at 10MP (like the Lumia 950 maybe?) but does that mean I can NEVER save the photos at the actual 40MP?

3. There's a Linus Tech Tips video (about the P30 Pro, to be fair) that said there was some notification that was impossible to swipe away and that instant messaging app notifications weren't coming through unless you opened the app itself.

4. Again, in camera, does the app have the feature where you can hold and drag to any point you want to select that for the exposure level?

5. I've read almost as much about the Huawei ban as about the phone's specs. Seems very clear that being released before the ban was implemented, this phone has no reason not to receive future updates, OS updates, or app and Google Play or services updates. Right? 

6. I'm concerned about what I've heard about Camera2API not being available for it. Is this true?

7. Finally, is there anything any of you found only with time that made you wish you had known before you bought the phone? 

I sort of hate the proprietary nm card idea, but honestly, with the needs I have (50% camera - 40% news, browsing, social - 10% gaming) I don't see a better phone for the price. I can't stand Samsung's UI, the LG I can get has a really unimpressive camera.

Maps - still works via an APK but you have limited use and cannot login. An alternative that works well and I have been using well before HMS is using Waze this came over as i brought stuff over from my previous device. 

Youtube - You can do this in two ways  1. you can go fully old school and hot link the browser version on to your home screen.  2. This is my preferred version and this is an app that you can find online called Youtube Vanced this allows for the full youtube experience.

Didn't see anybody mention this online (not that I could see hence this post) but I tried to install Google Maps on my phone via an apk (just searched online) and it installed and works fine, only thing is you cannot login - not a big deal.

Tried downloading Google Chrome, again works fine, just can't login to the app so it remembers your bookmarks etc but does let you login to Google as in the browser. Great! 

Tried downloading Google Photos, again works but doesn't let you login so bit useless. So for this, I just went to [photos.google.com](https://photos.google.com/) via Google Chrome and added to homescreen so Google photos has it's own icon, loads up full screen and lets you upload photos and videos nice and easy.

Matebook Pro X,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ie4ddp/matebook_pro_x/,"Hello everyone!

I am hoping to find some help with my Huawei Matebook X Pro. Last night I plugged in my computer and went to sleep. When I woke up this morning I couldn’t turn on my laptop. When I press the power button nothing lights up, there is no noises (like the fan whirring). It’s completely off.

I figured my charger had broken, so I tried another one. I also tried a different wall socket and neither of these solutions worked.

I tried calling Huawei support and I was told to hold down the power button and the volume up button together for ten minutes. This didn’t work unfortunately.

When I was looking around the internet I saw people who had a similar problem to mine and couldn’t fix it. They said that it was most likely a broken component and they took apart their laptops to try to replace it. I am nervous about this because I am not very technically skilled with computers.

Any advice or guidance you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated.",0,2020-08-22 08:14:56,763

Can't make/receive calls anymore and HiSuite backup won't work,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/idx3dm/cant_makereceive_calls_anymore_and_hisuite_backup/,"Hi all, I have a Huawei P20 Pro that I dropped at some point and cracked the screen. I've then had the screen module replaced, and things seemed to be great again, but apparently at some point after that repair my mic/speakers stopped working properly and when I receive or make calls, people can't hear me at all, sometimes I can't hear them at all, and sometimes we can hear each other but they get a massive echo that drives them mental and makes it impossible to call.  


This problem exists in calls but also in WhatsApp and other video chat/calling apps. The mic and speakers seem to work fine independently (although call quality has always been abysmal), and if I use a headset with mic it also works fine.  


Now, this happened shortly after the update to Android 10, but I don't make calls often enough to be able to say for sure if that was the precise moment it started, rather than having the screen replaced. I also can't say for sure if it's a software or hardware problem. The hardware seems to work, just not together.  


I've played around with the app permissions and network settings and enhanced call quality (can't remember what the setting is called anymore, the one that uses mobile data to enhance call quality), to no avail.  


Huawei recommended I do a factory reset, but I don't really want to and it turns out I can't without losing all my data, because HiSuite refuses to back up saying there's not enough disk space, regardless of what disk I try to write to or how much space is still on that disk. I've tried backup up just the app and system info, same thing. Tried to reinstall, reboot phone/computer etc, to no avail.

First of all I would heavily recommend you installing MicroG first, it gives you MapsApiV2, which means that location tracking will be way more accurate and way faster (before it took about 30 seconds, with MicroG it takes around 4 seconds). [Micro G Installation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/i5fhkf/microg_services_gms_for_all_huawei_devices/)

This just involves you going to the AppGallery, searching for Uber or UberEats and opening the quick app. After opening it, click the 3 dots at the top and choose Add to Desktop.

Question about the P30 lite,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/icuxt3/question_about_the_p30_lite/,"I am saving money for a new phone and I've been browsing around the Net for a model and I came across the Huawei P30 Lite. I really like the model it looks good, has a lot of cool features, nice cameras, lot of storage (128GB) even Mrwhosetheboss praised the phone calling it ""The best Mid-range phone"". But these sanctions and bans on Huawei made me really concerned about the services from Google mainly for Gmail because I use it a lot for University. Also about software updates, will the sanctions reflect on the older devices in some way (they have to reflect somehow) - like will the P30 Lite still get the newest software and security updates (or less)? Sorry if some of these are kinda dumb I've been trying to catch up with all of these events. P.S.  I'm from East Europe and I wonder if the restrictions are more light because of this (I doubt it but I still have hope).",2,2020-08-20 07:49:41,819

The fans run really loud even at idle. I've looked at HWINFO and it tells me that the CPU is running from about 40 ° C to about 50 ° C at idle with the ssd at about 45 ° C. The cpu temperature shouldnt make the fan ramp up like crazy so i have a sneaking suspicion that it's the ssd that is causing the fans to ramp up because ive done a lot of research and saw that someone said that as soon as their ssd got hotter than 40 ° C the fans started ramping up. Is there any way to cool the ssd? would getting a thermal pad to connect to the bottom of the chassis be worthwhile?

The cable worked great until it simply stopped working only recently. Since then I have had to use general cables that will charge my unit but not ""super charge it.""

A friend of mine gifted me a set of charging cables. It was really kind, he claims they should be name brand, they really seem like it too when it comes to build shape and quality of materials etc... Except for one issue.

The cables will in fact startup the super charging feature, but at some point (about 30 seconds after) it no longer claims to be super charging. The lightning bolt/text status simply change to the standard charging status.

It's not the orientation of the cable, doesn't seem to be junk in the port, it simply stops super charging in favor of a standard charge. 100% perfectly reproduces issue everytime.

What is going on here? I would try the cables on another device but I don't know a sole in town who uses Huawei. A quick Google search isn't doing me justice.",2,2020-08-19 15:16:07,847

(P30 Pro) Auto Rotate not working,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ibvcu8/p30_pro_auto_rotate_not_working/,"Am using a Canadian P30 Pro recently updated to 10.1.0.142. The prior update was to 10.1. Am not sure whether it was the 10.1 update or the 142 security patch that seems to have mucked up the auto rotate setting.

Even with the setting enabled in the quick access bar, the functionality has been pretty much not working most of the past week, started working Sunday and early Monday and seems to be stuck again.

Anyone else? The EMUI 10 broke Magazine Unlock for me and 10.1 brought it back. But having auto rotate is much more important than that.

Anyone else?

Edit:
Its working again now, I turned off my phone with the toggle enabled and it works fine even after toggling it on and off.",1,2020-08-18 17:50:03,883

I have seen that the Western Voice Assistant version is called 'Celia', and she can be setup for several different languages.

Buying a P40 Pro - Newbie,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ib9v5b/buying_a_p40_pro_newbie/,"Hellooo everyone!
I hope y'all good and staying safe.
Sooo for the past few days I've been looking around to buy a new phone. My current one is an old af Meizu M6 Note bought back on 2017. It served me pretty well but since Meizu ain't an official Google partner let's just say that I've faced the consequences of having used the GMS Installer and knowing the bugs that may occur.

After looking up several comparison videos  etc I'm really feeling it buying a P40 Pro, for several reasons some of these are : P40 Pro specs are wayyyyy too good and the raw performance of the phone is amazing in general plus the monopoly of GMS should halt at some point. Also I felt like Samsung, didn't put much effort on this year's mobiles and I get the idea that it's coz of the Huawei Google ban situation. To wrap this section up, I really felt drawn towards Huawei's products and I felt like they really did go all out this year.

Soooo, now my question is, is the AppGallery working good so far? Are there the mainstream apps available? If you guys decided to install GMS do you have problems with notifications/updates etc? I'm really not feeling it going through the same old bugs with the GMS shit show so that's why I'm asking if a normal user can co-op with the AppGallery.

Importing and Setting up a 'little brother' Honor X10 Max (Chinese Edition) in the UK,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/ias3v4/importing_and_setting_up_a_little_brother_honor/,"I hope your Moderator's will excuse this intrusion, in the same kindness it is given, as all the principle's are exactly the same. 

Listen up... I have constantly seen people drooling over new Huawei & Honor phones that are just not available in their area, well all the waiting is over! The one thing I am going to do here, is break up any fear or paranoia about ordering that 'must have phone' directly from China.

When mine arrived it, was the exact same phone as advertised, with the same specs.

This site was very useful... 
[Click here for the full specs](https://www.kimovil.com/en/where-to-buy-huawei-honor-x10-max)
It gives you a way to set your location, and then it will show you what bands will work where you live. But don't trust anything most websites say, with out double checking the phone specs with Huawei or Honor! 

Big news here... one thing that will be quite a big selling point, for a very large group of people (who have complained, and complained!)... It came with 'Huawei Call Recorder' factory installed, so now you can record those important calls, problem solved, without workarounds or Rooting a single phone.

The research I put in before ordering my Honor X10 Max directly from China (it had just been released on July 2nd, and it was not listed as a 'Global' edition), was quite extensive. First I had to double check the frequencies from my provider (O2 here in the UK), and then verify that they were available in the phone's specs. I contacted UK Honor support, and asked them what kind of support they would give me. Here is their reply..

I am afraid that for the time being we have very little info on the Honor X10 max, but once its officially supported in the UK we will have more information on it and be able to help with any queries on the device. 

However, if the device needs a repair, we will not be able to repair a foreign device in the UK. 

So, so much for the concept of being a ""Global Company."" 

I used Alibaba (easily 10 times larger than Amazon), and found several for sale, all offering international shipping. Alibaba offered a 30 day buyer refund, and shipping protection too. I picked the company that had been trading on Alibaba for the longest, ordered to have one shipped to me, asked for a UK power adapter, and it arrived in just 17 days. I was not charged for shipping, currency exchange, or even UK import duty. The bubble wrapping was superb, a Chinese/UK power adaptor was included at no cost, and it all emerged without a single dent or scratch.

The X10 Max's box was about a third larger than my 10 lite's (that's why they call it 'King Kong'. KKG-AN00), and the factory clear wrapping + and two seals were all intact (much to my great relief).

The contents emerged one by one... The phone (a Screen protector installed), a clear silicone case, USB 2.0 / type-C reversable connector (Convenient for connecting to any computer), 22.5 watt fast charger, the tool to open the Sim card drawer, and a bunch of paper all written in Chinese.

I started charging the phone, and held down the power button. The Honor color Logo appeared, but I knew something might be wrong immediately. The colors weren't moving at all, and as 2 or 3 minutes went passed, I thought I got ripped off.

Stuck, I pulled a factory reset. In hindsight this was a good idea, if someone had put some malicious software on it, it would be erased.

The phone woke up, and I was asked to pick my language (this option let me me pick mine from about 100 on offer), I then 'Cleared Cache', and picked 'Factory Reset.' It told me it was loading EMUI 10.0 and Magic 3.0. When it finished I was at the main screen, the phone was at 63% charge, and I immediately saw a bunch of Chinese writing around several Apps. The others were all labeled in English, so I realized that these were Chinese Apps for only Chinese consumers, and carefully deleted them all.

I shut the phone back down, and installed my Sim card. When I fired it up, for the first time in my life I saw I had 5G. I turned on data and looked for updates (I was expecting 2, that had been reported on different websites). Now this was a big test, if Honor would honor that update here in the UK. I found a big one, that said it was ready to upgrade to EMUI 10.1/ Magic 3.1 (with the June security update included). The download rate was very fast... between 4.2 and 5.2 Mb/s, so it took no time at all.
 
Settings told me that I had mistakenly installed the Sim card in slot 2, unlike where slot 1 is found in my 10 lite. It came with the Huawei Browser, Gallery (I had to update this to get rid of the Chinese characters, and changed the location to the UK), Support, and I found no other permanent bloatware. I checked with the Support App, and found I was given a 1 year Warranty (with mainland China), and free shipping both ways.

Phone Clone was fast too, at just under 20 minutes, 8.2 gigs crossed over @ 5.2Mb/s all with Bluetooth. All my Apps ended up in the same places as on my old desktop. All my Call logs & Contacts made it, along with all my messages and WhatsApp conversations too.

The keyboard was the biggest problem (half of it was in Chinese). It looked like a standard, simple, calculator keypad, so I used Gallery to download Microsoft SwiftKey, and changed my gestures to 'old school' 3 Key.

A notification came up before I could install SwiftKey... It was a message from Huawei, that warned me this App might collect my Passwords (gee the US spies on us too? 😂). It works very well, and when I'm using it... on the bottom right corner is a simple abstract of a keyboard I can use to switch back and forth between them. I ran Optimizer, and ever since, it only cleans up to a total of 95% (weird).

All my screen time was amazingly instantaneous, from complicated task to task. My bookmarks were gone on my Duckduckgo browser App (ouch), and most of my own Apps treated me like a first time user again.
I know I will not get Notifications from some Apps (WhatsApp, Reddit, ect), but that is fine with me... They all work!

I'll end by saying that I faced no discrimination from my telecom provider, and the phone is a complete delight to use. Here and there I see a Chinese symbol or two, but 99.9% of them are completely gone. ""Ceila"" (I hope I spelled that right) the 'AI voice assistant' only speaks in Chinese (she sounds very cute), something I'll work on rectifying real soon (I'll report that here in an update for you).

So now I have probably become the first... Dual speaker, 48/8MP, 5000mAh, dual nano Sim, liquid cooled, GSM/HSPA/LTE/5G, 7.09"" RGBW LCD screen, 6/128 Gig, Media Tek Dimensity 800 Octa-core (4x2.0 GHz Cortex-A76 & 4x2.0 GHz Cortex), 10.1/Magic 3.1, Honor X10 Max owner in the entire UK! 

[A better review of the phone... ](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/07/02/honor-x10-max-5g-launched-with-a-massive-7-inch-display/)

1. Download the firmware of your choice from the web. For the P40 european here's a link (it worked on my ANA-NX9 phone:

4. Select Update mode, then select Memory card/OTG update mode  


5. The phone will verify and install the firmware

Huawei TGL Expired.

What does this mean for those of us that own devices that still have Google apps?

I, for one, refuse to upgrade to a new huawei device for the sole reason... I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE ACCESS TO GOOGLE PLAY STORE. App Gallery just isn't up to scratch yet... Heck a lot of apps are simply missing or still ""coming soon"". This is a game breaker for me... No Google, no purchase!

My Honor 20 Pro still has the suite of Google apps, including Google Play... And for all intense and purposes (specs wise at least) is still a very up-to-date and powerful smartphone.

I guess, like a lot of other Huawei users, I want reassurance that Huawei will not let us rot because of Donald Trump's stupid rules.",3,2020-08-16 20:43:26,932

HiSuite and computer connectivity.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Huawei/comments/iapzwu/hisuite_and_computer_connectivity/,"  

Hello sub :)

I am having the following problem right now. 

I would like to back up my entire P9 Lite Smartphone data to my computer. Unfortunately, the HiSuite App on my device doesn’t even pop up, it doesn’t react at all. 

On the other hand, HiSuite on my computer recognize that a device is trying to connect through a USB-Port and it asks me for an 8 number PIN, which it should be regenerated on my smartphone. 

Is there a way to bypass that? USB-Debugging mode is active, HDB as well, latest EMUI installed today. I don’t know what else to do.

Does anyone meet the same problem?

Any advice or a suggestion would be much appreciated. 

Cheers!",1,2020-08-16 22:15:28,944
